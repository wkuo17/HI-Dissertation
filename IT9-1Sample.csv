"('1',)","Review Text 143: 3* only because I haven't completed the initial phase yet. I will update my  score after this period. However, I find that I would like a broader  vocabulary/choice of words for the current emotions section. I find that  the words there don't accurately describe how I feel. Example: Angery is  too strong of a word. Upset or frustrated would be better.",1
"('2',)","Review Text 145: I feel like emotions and feelings should include things like exhaustion and  nausea. Also, it would be great to be able to keep track of medications and  reminders to take them. I am currently still trying to balance my meds out,  trying new new types and doses. It would be amazing to track how those  things affect my mood over time.",2
"('2',)",Review Text 147: I like the Idea and it works well but I think the options it gives you when  entering emotions are all to similar and theres not enough. of the bad  moods it only has things like guilty and ashamed or nervous but is missing  things like sick or stressed. The same goes for the options for why you  have the emotions. Only having three reasons for my emotions to choose from  isnt really enough. but the rest is really great and the app looks very  nice.,2
"('2',)","Review Text 163: The previous version was fantastic. Simple and reliable. The new update added features that weren't necessary, but notifications aren't reliable at all anymore. I uninstalled and reinstalled to try to fix the problem. The problem persists but I lost all of my previous information.",2
"('2',)",Review Text 202: did my log for 14 days but it still hasn't gave me a doctor's letter and is  making me do it for another 14 days to get the doctor's letter even though  I have already done it. Please fix.,2
"('2',)",Review Text 386: I love this app for what it is but I am not a fan of the latest UI update.  It feels a lot more clinical and less friendly. Also harder to understand  at a glance. Are options going to be available?,2
"('1',)","Review Text 416: I really like this app except for one major downfall. It's not functional without an internet connection. To make an accurate evaluation, the app requires three quick surveys throughout the day, but at various times every day, I don't have access to the internet, so I miss rounds of questions, thus limiting the accuracy of my results. It seems very thorough with it's questions and the evaluation, but I can't state that with confidence, since I've been unable to complete a consistent full cycle of questions.   Pros: I like that it's very user-friendly, does not have ads, and is visually well-planned.  Add some offline functionality, and my rating would increase to four or even five stars.",1
"('2',)","Review Text 422: Accidentally put the wrong answer for the question and I can't edit it...so  it's going to be in accurate when I finish my 14 days.... Edit: So, it's  great for telling you where you are... I kinda figured that I was already  depressed but after the test and you reading the stuff it's sorta useless  after that, to me anyway. It's not like I can get the therapy or medication  that I need. But nevertheless it was good insight.",2
"('2',)","Review Text 966: I'm enjoying this app so far, except I just accidentally answered one of the questions wrong and wasn't able to change the answer. I feel like you should be able to go back and change your answer within a certain time frame, as now this will effect my overall outcome.",2
"('2',)","Review Text 1056: Doesn't take into consideration adverse eating habits other than loss of appetite, nor does it factor in self-harm. Overall it's a good app to track patterns in my mood, and help me pinpoint triggers.",2

"('1',)","Review Text 1177: I like the concept but I keep missing questions. I get the ""new questions available"" notification at the end of the time block, it seems. I go to answer them but they're locked out.  It notifies me at 11 pm which is fine but I can't submit anything. It would be better if there wasn't a strict time frame.",1
"('2',)","Review Text 1178: As far as apps go, it's very nice, great interface, no issues other than encountering a screen or two in a different language. As a diagnostic tool, it fails to take into account things such as stressful events, or prolonged other stress, illness, injury,  or pain that may precipitate or contribute to a depressive state. I think it could potentially send people running to their doctor with the app generated letter, seeking a prescription that they may not need or that may cause more harm than good. The letter generated after i used the app contained a contradiction regarding sleep. That seemed odd.",2

"('4',)","Review Text 32: I'm so disappointed in this app, a lot more used to be free on it but it's  now just another greedy developer preying on the vulnerable by making  nearly everything useful a premium only thing. Will be uninstalling and  will also no longer tell friends to use.",4
"('1',)","Review Text 62: I find this app very effective. My only boundary at the moment is the issue  of cost. What you are trying to achieve is very proactive, I wish there  were at least 4-5 health options but I'm going to work with what I have  until I can afford premium. I'm glad there is no hierarchy of followers and  no creepy people in your app. Thank you for your public service.",1

"('1',)",Review Text 519: hmmm my first impression are not great. I spent a long time figuring out what mood to choose. At that time I was devoid of feeling and emotion. No option for that. Secondly listening to the soundscape of the ocean waves. The voice sounded unbalanced and tidal waves too strong for my current status resulting in me feeling like I'm about to drown!! switched off app. I'm sure there are better options within this app.,1
"('2',)",Review Text 525: Great concept and has helped but no matter what I do the daily reminder always appears first thing in the morning when I have set it to 8pm at night,2
"('3',)","Review Text 664: It's decent . I know the creators need to get money somehow so they can't make everything free. I get that. but some features people don't care for so they're not going to want to pay for a monthly subscription for content they wont use. For example, I really only like the medition tapes, the rest isn't worth buying to me.  . Perhaps you guys can add an option where you don't have  to buy a subscription  to get some of the content . You can selectively  pay for what you want . Like  just pay for the premium  meditation content,  or pick 3 of the locked meditations for a certain deal. Or you can just buy the premium Journaling features if that's all you like . Idk.  I don't want it AL but a few of the locked medition would be helpful to me",3
"('2',)","Review Text 803: Support from others is great, visual goal setting is great, scaling my goals, relaxing background. All things no other app has.  This can get heated and no one will agree but people are also advertising HARMFUL mental disorders in this app. Great on you for being proud of some of these things its confidence boost. They need help not support down the bad path.",2
"('4',)",Review Text 1034: One thing I just noticed is that the volume of the speaker in Guided Paths are not constant. There are times that some words spoken are intelligible because the volume of the speaker suddenly drops.,4
"('3',)","Review Text 1062: It's a well put together app. Great ideas. Out of all the apps, the most reasonably priced, but still too expensive for what should be considered basic features. Anxiety and Stress meditations are pretty much all locked without a monthly subscription. Too bad",3
"('1',)","Review Text 1339: I'd like more organized settings around different features. Having the mood tracker pop up randomly throughout the day, having a set time for the thought catalog, a set time for the health checklist... otherwise I don't set aside the time and I only use the mood tracker even though the app offers a lot more. That being said, this is easily the best mental health app available. I'm excited to see what comes of it in the future.",1
"('3',)","Review Text 1351: It's great, and I even bought the subscription. But $30 a year is WAYYYY too expensive for what you get.",3
"('1',)",Review Text 1431: Like the app and will probably get a subscription if dev can fix the very slow ui. Lags between setting mood and moving threw the different screens. No reason it should be this laggy.,1
"('2',)","Review Text 1432: I have tried many different apps and websites and really like this one.  I like that it breaks down certain behaviors that can contribute to health.  That said, is it possible under the health tracking section to be able to add your own categories? Like whether I used my Seasonal affective disorder lamp or menstruation?",2
"('1',)",Review Text 1494: Things have been changed for the sake of change and it's more difficult to tag my moods because it says there was an error when I try to. Six buttons for moods is much better than the new way. I only put my basic mood now which isn't as handy,1

The whole entire app just deleted all I had saved and reverted back to start mode as if I had just installed it. minus 2 stars   I think it is good but not so good too, the app is useful for me because it is a time saver versus manual journaling but the loosing all my saved data sucks. total three stars for very useful, great features that are easy to use and a simple clean talk to text format I love.",4
"('2',)","Review Text 1: Resolution finally supports smaller and more normalized devices. Now i can see how bland this examination is a whole lot better, finding it on par with a random anxiety test online.

Useful but if youre together enough to look for help look for real help and not an app.",2

"('3',)","Review Text 226: First and foremost, there are so many bugs. Whoever is responsible for  developing this app needs to put in some serious work. The subscription fee  is utterly ridiculous, especially for an app that has such a long way to  go. I like the growth path, it has a lot of insightful ideas. However, I  don't like being repeatedly prompted to upgrade. If I wanted to do so, I  would. I don't actually understand why reviews are so highly sought by the  creative team behind this app. It's not like they pay any attention anyway.",3

I'm not subscribed to it and everytime i chat someone there's gonna be like a text above it about rule or some help text and it's more annoying than an ads. Well my broke ass can't afford the subscribe tho' i really want to be a listeners.,0
"('0',)","Review Text 310: I really loved. It's a place where you can find a lot of caring listeners who can really solve your problem. If they can't, then at least you have someone to talk to at any time..... That too for FREE!! The only reason I gave it 3 stars is that the app's interface isn't satisfying. The app just crashes sometimes and some options just don't seem to appear here. Waiting for updates.",0
"('0',)","Review Text 315: It helps as a temporary way out, most people are wonderful there. While some of the listeners could be a little better, and the fact that some aspects you have to pay for don't help - over all, it's wonderful.",0

"('2',)","Review Text 1343: I really like 7 Cups' features, especially covering fundamentals of coping. However, for an app designed to help those in need, I feel the premium packages are overpriced and unsympathetic, especially as a user who would benefit from a recommended path, but can't afford it.   Having to pay for better care seems counter intuitive; unless money isn't an issue or a stress factor for the individual which is in the minority.",2
"('0',)","Review Text 1353: It has a lot of potential. Personally, I felt it fell short. I was going to talk to someone but they missed the one meeting by hours and then never responded to me again.

The interface  just looks like a bunch of tools that you click on and engage with rather  than a friendly bot that it feels like you can confide in. Perhaps the  developers are losing touch with what is great about the app. The function  is still there, but it's starting to lose it's appeal. I've reduced my  rating to reflect this. -------------- Original: This is my first review of  an app, simply because I needed to thank the creators for this app. I've  studied CBT for a number of years and this has been the best companion that  simply condenses what a person needs into a persona that is friendly and  convenient. I mainly use the reframing of negative thoughts exercise. Give  this a go!",2

"('2',)","Review Text 413: First off - you have to know and understand what CBT is before really getting the benefit of this app. It's not meant for boredom. CBT is used for extreme issues with depression and anxiety linked to trauma. Next - I've tried a lot of different CBT apps and I really like this one a lot. It's intuitive and has a ton of tools to help me when I'm having a very bad time. CBT is dry and repetitive but Wysa softens the task and gives you that human ish quality of compassion you need when you're struggling. I've only been using this app for a short time and can tell it's going to be of great help. Last - my qualms are it hangs in loading content which is hard when I'm having an episode and sometimes I would rather do a good old fashioned thought record instead of reframing, immediately. I do not like being forced to do positive reframed thoughts without working the six step process through it.  That's it. Happy I have a pocket coach to help with my 2 therapists.",2

Maybe in another update problems that are ongoing and can't be changed could be addressed, because I get headaches after trying to reason with this program lol.

However the images load way too slow (the breathing shape took a whole minute to open ) and the chat doesn't seem to understand when you correct it. For instance if it understands that you're angry, it will keep giving messages related to anger even if you say ""I'm not angry"" or ""I feel lonely"". Also would be better if it asked information about the user in the beginning and if it tailored its messages based on that. For instance, does the user have a mental illness? Do they have family issues at home? Are they struggling with money? Have they tried medication/therapy/exercise before? That way the guessing doesn't have to be so wide.",1
"('2',)","Review Text 1679: I was really excited about the app but the AI seems to be driven 99% by a set sequence of responses. For example, if when it asks how you are feeling and you have mixed feelings it grabs the first emotion word it spots and misses the context. Its responses are formula driven which takes away from the sense of being understood. At the same time - if you are aware of this, and deal with one feeling and thought at a time it can be a great tool!

"('2',)","Review Text 1698: Cute idea, but needs a few more months/years to get good. Right now it's incredibly repetitive in a way that makes it blatantly obvious how little your input matters. It asks how you're feeling and defaults to one of a handful feelings (low, stressed etc). Then it asks you what situation made you feel that way and your answer to that question doesn't matter at all, because your input only triggers a question about what thought caused you to feel that way. Why not skip the situation question if the input doesn't matter at all? Because the ""main menu"" is so tedious, I really appreciate the hashtag shortcuts though. I also like that you can choose what exercise you want to do yourself out of all available options. Other apps only give you a random selection.

You would think with all of the complaints of how expensive the subscription is, from the majority of reviews, that something would be done about the super high costs.

This app, with the different focus areas, and the calm relaxing voice is just what I needed. I don't remember the high subscription costs when it first came out, which shows me that since it is so popular now, they want to make more money. That is very sad.

I wish wish wish (and have emailed to ask) if Headspace would sell the packages separately instead of a subscription. I'd happily pay NZ$5-10 for the next section or package bundle, that i can then download and keep on my device, rather than being locked into a recurring billing cycle. I also think that Headspace would make more money this way. Other Apps do this (e.g. Project Life scrapbooking app) so there is no technical reason Headspace couldn't do it too.

"('3',)","Review Text 5664: I think that Headspace is a great app for anyone trying to get into meditation or have tried to meditate before and couldn't stay dedicated due to lack of focus or an unrealistic expectation of what it is. However, I recommend just completing their free 10 sessions and just running with that whenever you need assitance or reminding of how to meditate. I have noticed that most of the meditation sessions are pretty much the same with a slight variation whether it be a longer session or just another exercise that will help you focus or stay relaxed just a little bit more. In my opinion, it's not much different than just repeating the 10 day pack. What bothers me the most about the app is it locks you out of most of the singles category. You must complete an entire pack that is related to that single to have access to it. Not only that, but the app highly encourages you to complete the whole foundation pack before moving on the other categories, and not moving to other ones until you finished another pack. As I had said before, each category is fairly similair and I feel as though this is their way of getting you to stay on their monthly subscription. This app is NOT a gimmick and truly does help those who want to meditate.

Not accessible for people with restricted income, no credit cards and broader needs.

The usability is also extremely poor, going so far as outright disabling the normal navigation buttons like 'menu' and 'back', forcing you to use the awkward nonstandard in-app buttons that jump from right to left to top to center depending on what screen you are in.

Would pay a 1 time fee but monthly is a bit much when there are so many free biblically based apps.  Not every one can afford to pay a monthly fee nor may it be good stewardship to do so.  This saddens me to know that you want to charge people to experience God on a deeper level.  Don't think He would want that.  If its all about Him I would think He would provide a way so that you would not need to charge people to go deeper with the One. which is one of the biggest problems today with the ""church"".  I get it ministries need money but why are you not trusting God to provide with your focus being to help and reach his people.  Jesus asked Peter 3 times ""do you love me "" and advised after Peter responded yes, ""then feed my sheep.""  If it's all about Jesus and not turning his house into a den of thieves why require a monthly fee.

The voice note function does not reliably record when I want it to. Sometimes the text becomes de-formatted after sending messages.

Lately the app scrolls all the way to the top of the message thread involuntarily -- leaving me with no choice but to either open and close the app or scroll down through months of messaging.

"('4',)","Review Text 12: Of the CBT Thought Record apps, this one is the best that I've found. It has a clean, simple interface. It is generally quick and easy to navigate, and there isn't a lot of clutter which makes existing records easy to find and read.   As good as this app is, there are a few usability enhancements which would really make this app rock: (1) Automatically save while creating a record. It's really easy to wipe out a draft record by accidentally pressing the back key on the phone. The CBT process requires a lot of effort (good thing!), so it is really frustrating when all of your hard work disappears because you hit the wrong key. (2) Make it easier to scroll through text boxes when creating a new record. Currently, the only way to scroll is to move the text cursor (not an easy task on a small phone screen). (3) Add ability to print thought records. While a mobile thought diary is great, it's hard to review the records with a therapist. It would be great if there was an easy way to print records in preparation for an upcoming therapy session. (4) Add a few customization options, like allowing users to add additional emotions (the built-in list is good, but overly limiting).",4

And the fact that you have to start from the top of the list after each time you record or edit an affirmation is EXTREMEMLY frustrating!!

"('4',)","Review Text 367: I give it a low 3 🌟 One star taken off due to being grossly over priced, and another for not having an alarm function so you can wake up to affirmations.

Perhaps better report options? Remember some of the people hitting on others could be lonely... Which is a problem in itself. Tough fix. Some changes I'd like to see: bigger text and interface buttons for high resolution mobile screens for easier viewing. Improvements to the profile area, including clicking on pictures for an easier view and better reply features so people can better respond to someone in comment chains. It's heading in the right direction. Hopefully it doesn't end up how 7 Cups of Tea did, which shamefully screwed a lot of vulnerable people over, both emotionally and financially.
