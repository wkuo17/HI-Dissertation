I improved my  mood in these days very much which makes me so pissed that I can't use them  into my final results because it shows that I didn't have any entries from  April 12 - April 19. Please fix this issue. I also dislike the new day  overview its kinda messy. In the previous updates it was easy and  organized. One last thing is the remainders. Yesterday I didn't get a  reminder for my last entry of the day. Please fix this issue too. I love  your app and I recommend it to many of my friends. So please fix these  issues.,0
"('0',)",Review Text 157: This app drags you through all of these days asking repetitive questions  and the end result is in no way whatsoever comprehensive. It's vague and  does not even touch on anxiety. It also doesn't always remind you to place  an entry and then will not allow you to go back and complete a missed one.  So disappointed with the three sentence result after 23 days. I'd recommend  using Daylio instead of this app. It's a mood diary that much more  efficiently helps you track your actions and moods which this app does  poorly and although Daylio doesn't provide a result at the end don't worry  because neither does this app! Rant over but wow what a waste of time.,0
"('0',)","Review Text 168: As someone diagnosed with depression and mood disorders, this app is  seriously lacking. I'd be in the middle of an panic attack and there wasn't  any questions pertaining to how I felt. Most of these options are too  limited to even make an assessment. Please go see a professional if you  think anything is wrong. Don't trust this. Thier response: Dear Kaylah, I'm  sorry to hear that Moodpath wasn't helpful for you at all. Currently, the  app is focusing on the criteria for a depressive episode (as defined by the  ICD-10 and DSM-5 classification), so there is no detailed screening for  anxiety disorders such as panic disorder. We will include questions on that  in the future.- Your Moodpath Team Thier title literally says ""depression  and anxiety"" and yet they are saying that they dont record anxiety? Then  why is it your title? Depression disorder includes mood- anxiety included.  Thier questions are not consistent which means questions from day 1 part 2  may not apply but do apply for day 1 part 3. But the questions are gone so  if you answer honestly it looks like you don't have depression. Depression  covers mood, behavioral, cognitive, sleep, and much more. Asking a total of  what 10 questions per day at random is not a diagnosis. Or even an attempt  at one. Your depression can lead to ocer eating, not under eating. It can  lead to anger, not sadness. This isnt reliable. Sorry.",0

I'm in the middle of a pretty severe depressive episode and downloaded this app to help me keep track of what I'm going through, but had to redo the first 14 days probably 4 times. And THEN this stupid app told me I'm fine, presumably because depression causes me to binge eat, not lose my appetite, and I'm not suicidal.

"('0',)","Review Text 1089: After two weeks of questions, Moodpath told me I don't show signs of depression. Its system, however, is fundamentally flawed. Let's start with:  1. It assumes that you have, for most of your life, been within the ""normal"" mood and self-esteem ranges. I have had depression my entire life, so questions like ""Do you feel less confident than usual"" were always answered with a ""no"" because I always lack confidence.  2. It assumes everyone's baseline mood is the same. My ""moderate"" mood is what your app would consider the ""worst"" mood, so I had a fair amount of difficulty defining my moods.  I think this app could benefit from a sort of pre-screening survey taken when you open it for the first time so it can tailor itself to your individual circumstances and needs.",0

But where I always drew the line in my mind was that it would be for those in need, and if I found a way to make money that would come second. When I needed help the most I couldn't work, and so I wouldn't be able to afford an app. Instead this app appears to lock out most of the features and present the user with a paywall only a couple clicks in, there promising a bright future of bliss.

"('3',)","Review Text 29: This Email is couple things that I feel need to be addressed. The first one  being that the quality of Listeners has significantly dropped since I  started using your service when it first came out. First as a member then  as a listener. The problem is that when I connect with a listener they  either don't respond after saying hello, or do not have the capacity to  respond in any sort of helpful manner. It's an issue of professionalism.  While I understand that you can't fully control the quality of listeners on  your service, I think that you can do more to screen potential listeners so  that you can provide a better service to those of us that are in need. The  people on the other end of these conversations are actual people with real  problems and if you do not do everything in your power to ensure that they  get the help they need, then what is the point? The other issue I have that  I feel needs to be addressed is the availability of your listeners that  supposedly are available but never pick up a request. I have searched for a  listener to take my request for up to an hour. And even when I do get  someone to respond, I get one word responses that show no amount of  interest or sympathy. If you have listeners that are online and they are  not actively taking requests then I suggest that you give them three  chances to take a personal request before locking them out of their account  for a period of time. This service is a great tool for those of us that  need someone to talk to but have nowhere to go for help. But if the quality  of your service is poor then you're not really helping anyone and I just  don't get the point. Thank you for reading this and I really hope you take  what I I've said seriously because I feel that it will help you with  creating a better service. Thank you.",3

"('6',)","Review Text 877: The therapist service for 7cups is predatory on people who need help and are looking for relief with their mental and emotional trauma. This service advertises that it is only $5 a day compared to in-person therapy session of $150, leading you into believing you are being charged for every day you converse with a therapist, to actually being a whole charge of $150 for the whole month after your three day trial.   I started the three day trial on a friday but therapist are not active on weekends, so the service is useless on those days but still counts toward the trial. So just to wrap up what you are paying for: for $150 month you get ""one"" message a day from a therapist for five days a week, so actually its around $7.5 dollars a month, which is a pointless statement because your not paying daily but the full month charge, why even say that!

They ask for payment to provide help and talk to a counselor, so why pay for something over a weekend or holiday if you simply can't.

"('3',)","Review Text 4983: As a person who struggles to find the right words when I'm in a dark place, and as someone who knows I need to talk but I don't know how/where to start, I did not find 7cups helpful. Counseling and Therapy are NOT free, you have to join a therapist talk for that, but the volunteer listeners will only do so much as listen, not council you, not ask any questions. I've been in a devastating situation when I could finally bring myself to open the app, only to find a lot of volunteers who surely are great people and have the best intentions, but they didn't seem to know how to approach someone in a difficult situation, and more important how to initiate a supportive conversation at all.  I felt like I was supposed to know 100% what I should be saying before trying to talk to them, and when I could finally expressed the distress about my situation I was met with very short-lined and nowhere-leading responses. I really appreciate the existence of apps like this, but this one didn't give me a positive experience. Also, even though I recognize that therapists must be paid to be able to offer their services, the therapist option is still unaffordable for many people including myself (the price is not part of my rating) It seems that in today's society, trying to be a mentally stable, functioning person requires cash by all means.",3
"('3',)","Review Text 4984: I've used 7 Cups a few years ago and it was helpful and simply amazing. So  why the 2 stars? First off, talking to a therapist here kosts so much which  should absolutely not be okay AND you only realize that AFTER you've given  in all your information. Secondly, the ""listeners"" nowadays think they're  therapists themselves, asking you to make an ""appointment"" with them so you  can talk about your feelings which, let's be real here, if you're anytgung  like me and have a panic attack you don't really wanna be waiting a few  days until you can talk to someone. It feels like these ""listeners"" are  just random other accounts that dont get background checked and thats very  unsettling as these are usually very personal things that youre going to be  talking about. And lastly, the interface is hard to operate and just a huge  mess and so unbelievably confusing.",3
"('3',)","Review Text 4988: I had this app for a little while. I was going through a bad time in my  life. I really thought that I had found something that could help give me a  lift. I was kind to everyone that I met on there and joined in a few forum  chats. One day I was very down and explained how my meds were not working,  how things were beginning to feel a little hopeless on my end. I am pretty  sure it was one of the counselors (I wish I could remember her name) that  decided to not focus or help talk to me about my situation, but decided to  embarrass me by saying they did not talk about medication because my med  may not work for me but it may work for someone else. Forget the fact that  I was deep in pain and confused about life. I left the forum feeling like a  scolded child and realized that no one, in fact, really did care. It made  me realize that people are only out to be politically correct and that  person whom I will never forget in theory, made me feel more alone in this  world than ever. So I hated this app. It was more than a year ago and I  will never forget how they made me feel. Thankfully I have gotten help  since then. But shame on you, whoever you were, for hurting someone who was  in pain. You will never be forgotten.",3

"('3',)","Review Text 85: The extreme irony between the app being designated as helpful towards relieving anxiety and panic attacks and how I felt before opening the app for the first time,and, how it was worse than before I opened it. At first I was curious and hopeful. Then I opened the app and read the instructions to ensure I knew how to use the app. Then I started the hypnosis session. The first thing I thought was the voice is very pleasant and then after listening for a minute or so to the woman slooooooowly explaaaaaaiiiinnngggg thhhhhhhe same instructions telling me nothing but where the settings are to adjust them and what they do. Well, after a few more minutes I thought, ""I really wouldn't want to have to wait sooooooooooooooo looooooooooong for the instruuuuuuuuuuctions to fiiiiiiiiiiinallllllyyyyyyy end that I was overjoyed to learn you could turn the instructions part off in the settings toooooooooo. So the VERY next thing I did, before hearing another single word, was run to the settings to turn off the annoooooooooyyiiiinglyyyyyy long instructions AS EVEN THAT MUCH HAD RAISE MY AXIETY TO ANGER! ONLY TO FIND BOTH SETTINGS THAT WERE EXPLAINED CAN'T BE ADJUSTED FROM ON.... TO OFF..... WITHOUT PAYING $3 TO DO SO!   Next, I came to leave this review, which has also taken time from my life and angered me even further. Do you see the irony yet? How about a full free version with a limited amounts of free uses. Perhaps I would have been able to listen to the actual helpful part, but, my anxiety level prevented me from being able to. Thanks for the learning experience though.

Keep in mind you need to enter in and out of sessions multiple times just to understand the cadence, so this maximizes the amount of potential ads you can see.

Sometimes, the knock knock jokes can be cute, but most of the time, they just distract from my interest in using the app. If I want jokes or cute distractions, there are plenty of places to do that, elsewhere.   The scariest part about recent updates is that Wysa is terrible at recognizing signs of self-harm/suicidal ideation. Asking if someone is considering ""something drastic,"" is fine, but Wysa likes to ask for the most ridiculous reasons.

However, the application itself is anything but usable. It lags, it fails to download the files, it becomes unresponsive all the time. Sometimes it shows the track as downloaded, but in fact it is not, and it just stops in the middle of a phrase, or (which is even worse) in the middle of a pause, leaving me unsure, if I should continue doing what I was doing, or something is wrong with the application.

"('6',)","Review Text 1147: I thought the meditations were pretty good but overall it felt a little trite and mostly unnecessary. I think development of a simpler breathing practice is a better,more impactful and empowering tool than relying on an app. Also don't see any need to get sucked into having to pay for ongoing content. Simply making time to start focusing on your breath. Try simple mantras, like ""here"" on in breath, ""now"" on out breath. Mindfulness works best when its minimal &lt;3",6

Before you renew, try this: Try reading an interesting Wikipedia article and then ask yourself if you don't feel as good as you did from the mindfulness.

After day 10 (40 minutes) I've realised that this app isn't for me. Essentially, it's just a reminder to stop, be still and try to clear your mind, which is fine. The issue I have is that it's just sitting listening to a man (with a very dreary voice) tell you to feel yourself breathe and that it's normal for the mind to wander as long as you bring your attention back to your breathing and how your body feels.

The day 10 session is pretty much non stop talking. Reminded me of a story from Chuck Norris about a Zen master who was supposedly meditating to loud music, so strong was his concentration.

How am I meant to afford this when my mental health is too bad to even have an interview let alone a job. Seems even at home solutions are inaccessible. No matter what I do to try to help myself get out of a rut, I'm faced with the same obstacles: help is only available to those that don't need it so much. Those that are healthy enough to have a job to afford such things or healthy enough to attend classes. Evidently, regardless of efficacy of methods, those that really need the help don't get access. Doesn't do much but make us feel worse. The more this same block happens, the more hopeless I feel. Too effed up to try solutions even if I want to...and people have a cheek to say they put things out there to try to help.

I don't want the screen to time out and lock while I'm watching. Either on or off. I don't want a million buttons and tiny miniscule little arrows and X's to tap on to navigate. The voice is plenty soothing and nice but the app isn't. It's just awkward and cluttered. You probably think it's easy because it's in categories but that's just clutter because it's burying things under layers upon layers.

"('0',)","Review Text 3554: It is overall great, a bit expensive, but amazing. Its fatal flaw:  Playing on your loss aversion to make you keep coming back through a daily streak that is kept front and center.  I have nothing against the idea of maintaining a daily streak, it encourages making meditation a habit, but there is a way to be smart about it.  Being hurt when you lose a streak is COMPLETELY irrational, but nevertheless a common response. The developers most know this, it is the reason that daily streaks are so effective at making you come back. We most not forget that this same mechanism keeps people chained to (""behaviorally"") addictive games.  If you are going to use a daily streak to make me keep coming back (which in principle I happily do) then please make sure to implement it properly: Take notes from the likes of Duolingo, which allow you to save up for days when doing Duo. might be impossible, and fix technical problems that do not save the sessions done when the phone was offline, NOTHING is more enraging than knowing you have done your Headspace and lose your streak anyway.  In short: Either fix the daily streak or remove it, so I can get back to loving this app.",0

"('0',)","Review Text 3558: Unfortunately, I cannot keep this Android app because the app cannot be moved to secondary storage.  I'm like every Android user and have limited available space on primary storage.  Because of the OS and other required data that must be stored on primary storage, I have to move apps to my SD card after I install them in order to make room.  I understand that users must first install apps to primary storage on Android.  That's fine.  Users should then be able to move apps like this to Secondary Storage in App Storage Settings.  This app does not allow that.  Sadly, I have to uninstall this app now since I don't have enough space on my primary storage to keep it.    To be clear, developers can enable apps to be moved to SD Cards.  I understand that there are legitimate reasons why some apps can't be moved to secondary storage.  For instance, App Widgets or Alarm Services will no longer work from apps run on Secondary Storage.  I'm not sure if those examples apply to this app, but again, my opinion is to let the user make the trade off.  Some users like myself will give up features just to be able to move the app to SD Storage.  For me, it's better to be able to keep an app with limited functionality than have to uninstall it altogether.    I've heard that some developers prevent their apps from running on SD Cards simply because the app may run slower.  I surely hope that is not the reason with this app.  My opinion is: Let the user decide.  As it stands, I can't use this app at all because I don't have enough space to keep it installed on my primary storage.    The reason that I believe this app deserves a lower star rating is because the developer has the option to allow this app to be moved to SD cards, but the developer has not implemented that.  Furthermore, other competing apps in the Google Play store can be moved to SD Cards.      SUGGESTIONS FOR THE DEVELOPER: If there is not an unsurpassable reason to allow users to move your app to SD Cards, then please change the ""android:InstallLocation"" attribute in your app to allow it to be moved to an SD Card after installation.  If you are worried about a second-rate user experience, then simply display a warning to the user of the functionality that will be lost by running the app from an SD Card.  If you haven’t heard this suggestion from other users, then please keep in mind that many are probably just uninstalling your app when they run out of primary storage space on their phone.  Users with an SD card in their phone usually have tons of available storage there, so there is never a reason to go through those apps and uninstall them.  In other words, another good reason to allow your app to be moved to SD Storage is the users are much less likely to uninstall it to make room for other things on their limited primary storage.    If there are legitimate reasons that your app can't be moved to a device's SD card, then please at least create a setting in the app that allows users to store the App Data on the SD card.  Thank you so much for considering my suggestions and feedback.  I'm passionate about this because I would otherwise like to be able to keep and use your app.  :)",0

It seems to be a larger headspace problem as it occurs for me on my computer, Android phone, and iPad and on multiple networks. (Though it is most likely to occur on my phone). It's meditation, so doing the same one repeatedly is alright, but not worth the steep fees they charge.   I spent 3 months trying fixes I found in forums and installing new updates then contacted customer support. After a month of back and forth they said they were not able to ""to replicate the behaviour you're describing on our end."" After further back and forth they were able to refund my subscription.

"('0',)",Review Text 5206: There are 2 types of apps-Free & Paid. But Headspace is a smart app that makes u feel intelligent by repeating the same thing over n over for 10 days and by the end making you believe that if you purchase/subscribe you'll be able to open up a world of amazing knowledge and spiritual gain. Alas! It's such a paradox. Just by getting a great voice-over artist to do your voice does not qualify you to be a spiritual guru or capable of giving spiritual experiences. It's a fluke. Damn!,0

When I randomly opened the app a few hours later it showed me logged in only to be at the same meditation I had already completed. Stats still not synced.

"('0',)","Review Text 5593: I just uninstalled this app and canceled my subscription out of frustrations with the Headspace UI and approach to its users. The UI for choosing meditations doesn't allow you to skip ahead in its sessions, to make sure you do each meditation in order--which is fine, until something breaks. As a result of my imperfect home internet connection, sometimes Headspace wouldn't log me as having completed a session--but then I couldn't skip ahead to the next one anyway. Frustrating, the opposite of why I subscribed.    Every tech product will have technical difficulties at some point--that's fine. But most products don't hobble users' ability to troubleshoot problems themselves.  The app's meditations themselves were fine, but you can find similar guided meditations by searching for ""MBSR"" (or ""mindfullness base stress reduction"") on youtube.  **Edit: I reached out to the Headspace support team before writing this review and uninstalling the app, and it did not change my concerns about the Headspace UI.",0

For all the options/speakers/sources available, it's usefulness is offset by it's operationally functionality, or the lack thereof. I want an app that allows me to be in control of what I want to do, who/what I want to listen to, where I want to go, and not what the app (or someone else) thinks. And, to be forced to listen to an advertisement for a premium membership subscription, nearly every morning, before being allowed to proceed with listening to the daily devotional, is disruptive and annoying. (Were a premium subscription desired, one would be requested.) I simply want to be able to listen, dwell, and focus, on the inspiration of a daily Bible devotion without all of the bells, whistles, and distractions this app seems to have.

If anyone needs help in determining whether or not spend money on this service, read my review.  This is what the app IS: A place where you can vent. If you don't have journal at home or a journal-like space on your computer and you would prefer if that journal occasionally talked back, this is for you. If you feel like you can't talk to friends/family about something in your life, this is for you. It's an app for lonely people to feel less alone. It's a place to air your thoughts. It's a place where someone will ""listen"" to you and tell you sympathetic things. (Examples: had a breakup, pet died, moved to a new city, fighting with a roommate, don't like your school or teachers, considering a career change)  This is what the app is NOT: a place where you can find comprehensive, in depth therapy for serious/legitimate mental issues and pressing life concerns. If you are really struggling and you need to work with someone because there are problems that are consuming your life. DO NOT BE TEMPTED BY THE FACT THAT YOU CAN ACCESS THIS ""THERAPY"" FROM ANYWHERE INCLUDING HOME; PUSH YOURSELF TO SEE A *PSYCHOLOGIST* OR A *PSYCHIATRIST* IN PERSON! A lot of the responses will be taken straight out of a textbook. If you are having a really hard time this WILL NOT HELP YOU.   (Examples: depression, dealing with the death if a loved one, self-esteem issues, anger issues, bi-polar disorder, suicidal thoughts, phobias, divorce, addiction, etc.)  My experience is that this appears to be a part time job for the therapist/counselor. You're a second thought despite the price. I tend to hate leaving my house so I thought this app was for me. Considering the severity of my symptoms, filling out charts and being sent photocopied suggestions was not what was going to help.   I think we really, truly need to reassess what we consider to be counseling and what we consider to be therapy before applying that label to various services. In addition, clients should get one month free so that they don't have to find out at the end of $140 dollars that this is not going to help them at all.",3

"('0',)","Review Text 773: I was very unhappy with Talkapace. Prior to using Talk space I had been in talk therapy 2x a week for several years. After gaining some new coping skills and adjusting my thought patterns, I began tapering down my sessions and eventually stopped seeing my therapist in person. While I still have work to do, I downloaded talk space as a potential safety net -- a place where I could continue working on the skills I had learned in therapy without the constraints and expense of seeing someone in person. However, I found talk space incredibly frustrating. My therapist often incorrectly assumed the gender of my partner and focused our conversations towards unproductive topics. Many of my concerns are related to stress management and methods for avoiding a negative thought spiral when feeling overwhelmed. However my therapist continued asking me to list the specific items that were stressing me out and to practice mindfulness techniques. This approach is something I have done in the past without any success. When I mentioned this to my therapist, he suggested reading ""The Power of Now"", which I found completely useless. Overall I felt my therapist did not understand my goals and had one technique he kept pushing in different ways. I explained this to my assigned therapist before requesting a new one, but by the time I was given new options I was too discouraged and frustrated to continue the program. I still get emails about talkspace despite requesting they remove my information and delete my account. So now I am writing a review.",0

"('6',)",Review Text 3456: The app is not worth any money. I definitely wouldn't pay that much for it. I especially wouldn't pay when I can  get everything this app has to offer on YouTube.

She took up space on Shark Tank with no apparent intent to really get investors.  She just wanted free advertising. I find that abhorrent.  I agree with those who called her a gold digger. If she really cared the free app would be at least somewhat decent. What a waste of space.,6

Then I have to go threw all kinds of time and energy to get my money back that you should not have taken out in the first place. This is so dishonest and sneaky. You guys should try and make your business success off of your product not by stealing people's money that are trying your so called trial. So if anyone wants to try your seven day free trial I would cancel before five days or they will charge you too!! To bad to the product could've been a success but I think your sneaky and dishonest and I'd rather wait for someone else to come out with the same thing.,6

"('0',)","Review Text 300: While the intention of the app is noble, the sounds/sound design is AWFUL. You've got CARTOONY sounds, some of which don't fit (spiky ball) , though you've got a few decent realistic sounds (the small bearings that you can roll around, the keyboard key, and I guess the switch/chalk? ) Sound is a huge deal that deserves more attention than a mute button. Heck, it doesn't feel receptive to my input at all. A finger tapping/dragging for a second should make a shorter sound than a longer, drawn out motion for items like the window and chalk games. Not to mention the physics and sound combining into something monstrous in that 5-ball pendulum, where you hear a rapid series of clicks as momentum is transferred from end to end when there should only be 2 - 1 going out, and 1 returning. And looking at the trailer for the ""quiet pack"" shows that the sound is of similar quality. For crying out loud, it's 40 bucks for a mic and you can probably make most of these sound better by recording physical objects instead of bothering with what I'm assuming are stock sound effects.  I'm mad, but this is an ire of passion. I see this app has some potential but I'd honestly rather use real items because this is nowhere near passable, even if it's free, and real life doesn't sound like a cartoon.",0

However, I've now been trying to upload affirmations for probably the last hour. When trying to upload numerous affirmations you must do them individually or maybe two or possibly three at a time. The recording time cuts off very quickly. So I began to do that and after recording probably 25 or more individually, I went back to listen to some of them and it has very low sound quality, they cut off quickly and it was actually just repeating the last affirmation that I had recorded.
