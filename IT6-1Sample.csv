"('4',)","Review Text 14: OK app but dilo is better and the reports moodpath prints sucks they are a  one page print out with a graph only no text, one thing that is needed is  when it asks personal questions about death and if you have a plan one of  the options should be that you are currently receiving treatment as many of  us are but still have the thoughts, it is important that the app track this  but know if the user is already getting help for that issue.",4
"('3',)","Review Text 18: Just getting started with it. It seems good for reporting my mood, but so  far nothing is actionable. Maybe reporting will be more useful when I've  collected more data.",3

"('0',)","Review Text 73: Starting with three stars as this is only my first day. The app does what  it says. It is VERY well designed, including ergonomic decisions regarding  app navigation that feel specifically made for those with the lethargic  symptoms of depression.

"('0',)",Review Text 127: Used last few days but so many problems today. Won't let me submit today's  entries apart from partial midday one. Also the option of going back to a  question would be good as I answered 2nd question as yes but should have  been no. Feeling quite frustrated with it today.,0
"('2',)","Review Text 141: I like this app and what it does, but a huge flaw is that it doesn't work  offline. I have 8hours a day with no cellphone connection, which means no  tracking at work. Also the notifications stopped after a couple of days so  I would miss my 3 entries a day, which I believe let to an inaccurate 14  day diagnosis (though that wasn't what I was using the app for, more for  just general tracking.) Would be perfect if the notifications worked and if  it was functional without an internet connection.",2
"('0',)","Review Text 143: 3* only because I haven't completed the initial phase yet. I will update my  score after this period. However, I find that I would like a broader  vocabulary/choice of words for the current emotions section. I find that  the words there don't accurately describe how I feel. Example: Angery is  too strong of a word. Upset or frustrated would be better.",0
"('0',)","Review Text 145: I feel like emotions and feelings should include things like exhaustion and  nausea. Also, it would be great to be able to keep track of medications and  reminders to take them. I am currently still trying to balance my meds out,  trying new new types and doses. It would be amazing to track how those  things affect my mood over time.",0
"('0',)",Review Text 147: I like the Idea and it works well but I think the options it gives you when  entering emotions are all to similar and theres not enough. of the bad  moods it only has things like guilty and ashamed or nervous but is missing  things like sick or stressed. The same goes for the options for why you  have the emotions. Only having three reasons for my emotions to choose from  isnt really enough. but the rest is really great and the app looks very  nice.,0
"('0',)","Review Text 148: Before the most recent app update the app was really good. I liked  answering the yes and no question because it added a level of personal  touch as if someone was actually asking you. However, since the new update  and removal of the question I find myself not really using the app much now  because the question have gone and the emotion selection is rather limited.",0
"('0',)",Review Text 159: This app was brilliant until the recent update. I'm not sure why things  have to change that were working. I no longer receive notifications as  others have also mentioned. The new part at the end asking about feelings  and situations doesn't give you enough options.,0
"('2',)",Review Text 161: Filled things out for 14 days and was never given a review. The app also  just stopped giving me notifications all of the sudden. I feel like it  stopped working after having it for 14+ days...,2
"('0',)","Review Text 163: The previous version was fantastic. Simple and reliable. The new update added features that weren't necessary, but notifications aren't reliable at all anymore.

"('0',)","Review Text 164: It's good but the questions don't have enough options. In the ""How do you  feel right now?"", the options for answers are terrible, and i always end up  skipping it. Just add more answers and make it more in depth.",0
"('0',)",Review Text 167: It started out great I finished the 14 days and never received my results.  I don't know why. I am now starting a new cycle just to give the app a  second chance. So to me it's just OK.,0

"('2',)","Review Text 183: It's a great app to keep track of your emotions, however, when I finished  my first two weeks it deleted all previous data and never gave me a  doctor's note or anything.

"('4',)","Review Text 218: The app runs smoothly and functions as it should, and so far it's been a  huge help to me. But, the one problem I have is that the mood tracker  doesn't seem quite accurate enough to me. It lets me input my mood three  times a day, but sometimes I end up having a huge mood change in between  these periods which ends up not being counted. Say I wake up feeling well  and input that I'm in a good mood. Then an hour later I feel absolutely  horrible, but it's not counted, and by the time my next input is going to  be counted my mood has gone back up to moderate. Then because of this, the  app ends up saying that over the past three days I've been ""hardly  distressed"" while I personally know I've been really struggling from time  to time. What's worse is that when I am in such a horrible mood, that  ""hardly distressed"" just feels like a mockery; though I guess I can't blame  an algorithm for that. Regardless, I do feel that the mood tracking could  be made more accurate, especially since it would seriously help for people  with such unstable moods like myself.",4
"('2',)","Review Text 223: I really hated it. It would work with my TalkBack application hardly at  all. In fact after the first page or so in the first couple of questions, I  had to go ahead and uninstall it because I couldn't get it to work. Too bad.",2
"('0',)","Review Text 228: Tests are too shallow, it advocates for some really bad things in the  knowledge section and the notifications for getting the usual test broke as  well after a little while.",0
"('0',)","Review Text 229: I like it except it asks questions like ""are you sleeping more than usual""  and the answer is no, but I usually sleep way more than I should so I think  that should be what's tracked",0
"('0',)",Review Text 240: I had no problems with notifications as some others have said they had  trouble with this. However after finishing the 14 day survey I still cannot  view my results or doctors letter. Instead it says that it will unlock in  14 days.,0

"('0',)",Review Text 386: I love this app for what it is but I am not a fan of the latest UI update.  It feels a lot more clinical and less friendly. Also harder to understand  at a glance. Are options going to be available?,0
"('0',)","Review Text 405: Cool idea, but fails to prompt me to answer mood questions on time. Sometimes the notification appears, and sometimes it doesnt. I open up the app and expect to be prompted THEN, but get nothing - just a little green dot next to the date where the counter previously was. Not a huge deal, but ive missed multiple entries because of this bug.",0
"('0',)","Review Text 409: Having an issue where some completed questions don't get successfully recorded. I write notes and complete all questions, get a successful notification, but when I go back later in the day, it shows an 'X' for the question I answered for that period. Has happened 3 times now, not sure I want to continue for the full time given it is missing my completed data.",0
"('0',)","Review Text 416: I really like this app except for one major downfall. It's not functional without an internet connection. To make an accurate evaluation, the app requires three quick surveys throughout the day, but at various times every day, I don't have access to the internet, so I miss rounds of questions, thus limiting the accuracy of my results. It seems very thorough with it's questions and the evaluation, but I can't state that with confidence, since I've been unable to complete a consistent full cycle of questions.   Pros: I like that it's very user-friendly, does not have ads, and is visually well-planned.  Add some offline functionality, and my rating would increase to four or even five stars.",0
"('0',)","Review Text 422: Accidentally put the wrong answer for the question and I can't edit it...so  it's going to be in accurate when I finish my 14 days.... Edit: So, it's  great for telling you where you are... I kinda figured that I was already  depressed but after the test and you reading the stuff it's sorta useless  after that, to me anyway. It's not like I can get the therapy or medication  that I need. But nevertheless it was good insight.",0
"('0',)","Review Text 450: For the most part, it is okay for mood tracking. When you get to the treatment and Doctor's note, the note is fairly innacurate. I wouldn't give it to an actual doctor. There are better apps out there for this stuff.",0
"('0',)",Review Text 456: I am giving it 3 star just because I have a doubt whether the app will ask money for giving me my result after 14 days. All my expectations and anticipations will be ruined if it did. If I get a reply regarding this I will change the rating. Peace.,0
"('0',)","Review Text 481: Great questions, which could be construed to be leading towards depressive  connotations. Unable to complete a full record as notifications don't  always come through. Even though there is a notifications option in  settings, I have to consciously log in to answer the question set or I miss  them forever. There is no way to override missed questions once they've  happened, and you feel like a wronged child (you missed the questions so  it's your fault)",0
"('0',)","Review Text 488: Definitely one of the better apps out there, but not exactly what I was looking for. With ""mood"" in the title I was hoping to track my mood including other emotions besides sadness, but the app seems very focused on depression/sadness. I was also surprised that despite answering every question, at the end of the 2 week period the app determined I was not depressed. I have been diagnosed with major depression for 10 years, and seek ongoing therapy for it. I wish you could have picked and chose the questions they asked in each session. There were times I felt hopeless but the question for that was not asked, and vice versa. I tried the app for 3 weeks but personally feel it has a lot of room for improvement.",0
"('0',)","Review Text 491: I like the content and idea of this app. However, my intent was to find something that will track symptoms (including anxiety as well as depression) and check for episodes on an ongoing basis, and this one seems only to work in 14-day blocks, with no overlap. This means having to have an idea of when to start tracking, and then having to wait 2 weeks, while in potential crisis, to confirm. My ideal app would track on an ongoing basis (not necessarily always 3 times each day, but at least checking in once in a while), and look for patterns in the background, and have options for the timing of the regular alerts so they don't come during when I know I can't answer them.",0
"('3',)",Review Text 497: Found not so useful for me. Same questions...cycled over and over. I would have kept if questions were more in depth and less frequently repeated.,3
"('0',)","Review Text 522: It would be helpful for having info to take to initially therapy session.  However I am not a fan of the ""burden weights"" and the mood faces and the results rely heavily on them. TL;DR I went through twice now. The first time I tried to be honest but felt weird about them. By the end of first week the app was offering info for more immediate resources. The second time through I only answered the questions honestly and used the lowest weight and mostly the moderate or bad mood choice (which is how I would answer if asked in real life.) Even after answering the questions honestly with clear signs toward SI ""good future?"" No ""thinking about death?"" Yes. But the app did not react buy offering the helpline like before because I didn't use the weights. I would think this would misguide others that are also prone to underplay their symptoms.",0
"('0',)","Review Text 590: One of the better mood trackers but unfortunately the notification system  consistently craps out. Currently only getting reminded once a day, instead  of 3x.",0
"('0',)","Review Text 611: The app the design the contexts of the language used are all professional n destressing by itself, except the methodology of asking three questions which are uneditable and the weightage which we have to assign to them by itself makes it more stressful. Except the micro bursts which u might face inside this extremely cute n happy app I was happy with it, until it had no actual actionable resources i can actually use to better myself or get myself out of the haunting questions they pose.  Suggestions? I think all these 3 threatening questions should be balanced or ironed out with a mental whip before they throw us a grand finale of smileys to choose from. The smileys are the worst to assign your emotions, I'm human not a robot to decrypt my complexed emotions like that. In those circumstances, it was really hard n depressing to cross over that page. I almost always felt that I didn't want to put my whole day under one emotion esp not with that freaky smileys.  Takeaways for me? Even though it was a bittersweet torture I lived those 14 days to see the greatness unfold. You tend to get a better grip on your mood swings with this app n it can get better IF the app is more polymorphic rather than being rigid with their questions, weightages n IMAGES ( which were very creative n pleasing but repetitive n uninspiring ).  P.s: u guys need some actual human person who is going through big troubles to design this app for the troubled ones",0

"('0',)",Review Text 934: Interesting app so far. But it's frustrating that it doesn't always alert me when questions are available and then I miss my chance.,0
"('0',)","Review Text 935: this app is definitely targeted towards people who are just first getting the onset of depression than someone who has it chronically. A lot of questions ask you to reflect on your past (ex. is your self confidence clearly lower than usual?) but for me my self confidence is EXTREMELY low but usually always like that, but I put ""yes"" because it's not clearly lower, it's just as bad as always.",0
"('0',)","Review Text 966: I'm enjoying this app so far, except I just accidentally answered one of the questions wrong and wasn't able to change the answer. I feel like you should be able to go back and change your answer within a certain time frame, as now this will effect my overall outcome.",0

"('3',)","Review Text 1108: It's okay, but I wish it would have a noice alert when altering me of a new question.   Also, I wish it would tell me the time of the next question, and not just ""Morning"" ""Midday"" and ""evening"" I've missed most of my alerts because of this.   Also, I'd like there to be a time alert thing, like clock. You set it is when the next question comes and it rings like clock you'd use when getting up for school or work. I don't remember the name of it, but I think you know what I mean.  Anyways, it's a good app, just the alert issue is making it difficult to use. But over all, a good and helpful app. :)",3
"('2',)","Review Text 1111: I was really excited about this app, until I could answer the questions! I would get notified only half the time, and even when I was ready to be there as soon as it notified me, by the time I unlocked my phone it didn't allow. Me to answer the questions. Would be a great tool if it was working properly. Will uninstall for now, but will keep on my radar once bugs have been fixed. An app like this shouldnt be frustrating.",2

"('2',)","Review Text 1117: It's a brilliant idea, it just has several bugs that need to be worked out. The notifications are extrodinarily inconsistent and a couple of times it has actually recorded my input on the wrong day.

But I'm often missing slots because I'm not constantly on my phone, I answered the morning questions around 10:30 and it says the afternoon questions are available midday but it's almost 2pm and I can't answer them, it also has a timer saying I can't answer more questions for over three hours, that takes me to 5pm, so evening questions are going to be really late?

"('0',)","Review Text 1178: As far as apps go, it's very nice, great interface, no issues other than encountering a screen or two in a different language. As a diagnostic tool, it fails to take into account things such as stressful events, or prolonged other stress, illness, injury,  or pain that may precipitate or contribute to a depressive state. I think it could potentially send people running to their doctor with the app generated letter, seeking a prescription that they may not need or that may cause more harm than good. The letter generated after i used the app contained a contradiction regarding sleep. That seemed odd.",0
"('2',)",Review Text 1189: It's not bad... It is a simple mood tracker... Easy to use... would get a higher rating from me if you could set the times of the day you answer the quick questions... As it is now u can only set ur wake up time.. OK so I wake up at 630am... By 11 am it's asking me about my day... Well the day hasn't even really begun... So when it prompts me again at 6pm to ask about my day and mood... I haven't even gotten home from work!  Home life definitely has an effect on my mood... IDK by 6 how I'm going to feel at bedtime at 11pm... Not being able to set specific times means I miss them... I don't have my phone at work until breaks... In fact... Not being able to set the times is unfortunately the reason why I have gone to another app... PLEEEASE FIX THIS!,2
"('4',)","Review Text 1192: I was really enjoying your app until...I noticed a huge inaccuracy. It has to do with ECT (electroconvulsive therapy). Because of severe depression, and PTSD, I was subjected to that horrible ""treatment"". That was around 6-7-8? years ago, I can't remember. It drastically damaged my short term memory. I had actually forgotten I had even had ECT, until a Facebook memory showed up, talking about it.  My long term is still pretty good, but my short term continues to be horrible! Please don't say it has no long term memory effects, that might encourage people to try it. One of the worst decisions of my life!! Please rethink, and more accurately describe ECT, in your lessons.

"('0',)",Review Text 1204: I really like the app I like that there's a set of questions instead of rating your mood levels. However I wish that you could go back and answer questions that you might have missed earlier in the day due to being busy or not having your phone on you or whatever the situation may be versus if you miss the morning questions not being able to go back and answer those because I think it would give a more accurate and say at the end of the 14 days those days not counting those answers in due to being incomplete. If there is a way for the developers to change that to where you can select the entry questions that you might have missed and go back and reflect and answer those questions for that time period I would rate the app 5 Stars with no questions or problems; but not having that option is a major downfall in my opinion due to the fact that life happens and it's not always possible to answer those questions or  that notification right at that time.,0

"('0',)","Review Text 476: Although I liked the concept of the app it has many flaws. The user utilises their own rational thoughts along with a mood tracker to track and challenge negative thoughts, it certainly cannot replace an actual psychiatrist. Although I was beginning to enjoy recording my thoughts and studying my patterns, an app can't do much for people suffering from anxiety and depression where everything feels hopeless. This brings me to my second point, there are far too many glitches in the app. While making entries in the 'traps' section the labels are often misidentified. While typing on my android 7.0, words are often blocked on the screen because it doesn't adjust or scroll down and the keyboard blocks the words. I really needed the app today morning to record my thoughts, but I was let down. The app failed to sign me in, it failed to recognise my email address when I thought my password was incorrect.

"('3',)","Review Text 696: Strictly speaking on the 'Thoughts' section: while it is a clever way to reflect on behavioral patterns, specifically speaking on 'Traps', the app continuously glitches which is a shame because I think that tool could be very helpful. While using Traps, I was faced with a lot of problems with typing, as in the text box would not load properly and I would be unable to see the top line. Then while highlighting lines, the tool seems to be susceptible selecting unwanted words, which of course warrants the selection of 'Traps' to appear, but while trying to leave that page, the screen malfunctions into just text of what the trap descriptions are and asks for you to confirm the desire to leave, without giving you use of the 'x' at the top left  corner, ultimately making you delete all your work. If you somehow make it past that, there is an overview of the entire entry and where the trap reflections are listed, my reflections are constantly unmatched to their traps and when opening them, the order of the reflections switch every time.

Members expect too much from the listeners and are disrespectful. Listeners often take up 5 chat requests at a time, so their reply rate can be extremely slow and frustrating.

The little things that go wrong in life won't matter in the future, and I think you people should be trying to drive that point home above all others; if nobody thought about their problems, they wouldn't be sad, and they wouldn't feel the need to kill themselves.

"('0',)","Review Text 95: First off, I love this app for what is is: a research study on mental health, with the hope of being able to find patterns in mood to determine triggers for anxiety. That is awesome, and definitely something I would love to be a part of. Definitely would encourage others to participate to help further the study, and to help get a deeper understanding of your mental health.  The pros: - consistent thorough checkup questions which cover a good range of emotion, and show excellent patterns in mood - heart rate check is a definite love for me The cons: - the app store description headline is very lacking, and should include the fact that this is a research study there - the functionality/aesthetic of the questions could be GREATLY improved-- it does the job, but lacks care, or depth to the interaction - the sleep tracking hasn't seemed to work yet, and manual add on is not appearing beyond the check boxes to enable it - weather and step counter appear on the dashboard but show no information, and I can't find a way to do anything with them  - overall could be much more user friendly; very pretty (aesthetics of the dashboard) for how simplistic the app currently is",0

I've reduced my  rating to reflect this. -------------- Original: This is my first review of  an app, simply because I needed to thank the creators for this app. I've  studied CBT for a number of years and this has been the best companion that  simply condenses what a person needs into a persona that is friendly and  convenient.

"('4',)","Review Text 413: First off - you have to know and understand what CBT is before really getting the benefit of this app. It's not meant for boredom. CBT is used for extreme issues with depression and anxiety linked to trauma. Next - I've tried a lot of different CBT apps and I really like this one a lot. It's intuitive and has a ton of tools to help me when I'm having a very bad time. CBT is dry and repetitive but Wysa softens the task and gives you that human ish quality of compassion you need when you're struggling. I've only been using this app for a short time and can tell it's going to be of great help. Last - my qualms are it hangs in loading content which is hard when I'm having an episode and sometimes I would rather do a good old fashioned thought record instead of reframing, immediately.

While this isn't bad, as many people respond positively to that approach, this can be off-putting for those who want to just vent to Wysa and let Wysa get to know them, before delving into their problems. Hence, I think this app would be much improved if there was an option to let the user simply chat, whether it's about the weather, new shoes, or a long story about how a situation led to the person's current distress, it shouldn't matter. Let Wysa also be a friend who is just there to truly listen and offer empathetic responses, when needed, because, sometimes, people just need to talk.",1

For instance if it understands that you're angry, it will keep giving messages related to anger even if you say ""I'm not angry"" or ""I feel lonely"". Also would be better if it asked information about the user in the beginning and if it tailored its messages based on that. For instance, does the user have a mental illness?

Its responses are formula driven which takes away from the sense of being understood.

It asks how you're feeling and defaults to one of a handful feelings (low, stressed etc). Then it asks you what situation made you feel that way and your answer to that question doesn't matter at all, because your input only triggers a question about what thought caused you to feel that way. Why not skip the situation question if the input doesn't matter at all? Because the ""main menu"" is so tedious, I really appreciate the hashtag shortcuts though.

"('4',)","Review Text 1806: This app is quite good actually and it has also helped me... The mindfulness exercises suggested are pretty good too.. One thing i would suggest you to add is an option to ask the user the elaborate the problem..venting sometimes helps more than problem solving.. You can also further work upon it to give more options on the emotions.. Moreover for people who have faced some serious tragedy in their lives,  after identifying the emotion,  wysa can ask the user to select the nature of the problem from a range of categories,  such as loss of someone, end of a relationship,  stress in work Or any other etc. After selecting one the user can tell wysa in details about his or her problem..  This way it might be easier for it to identify the user's problem. After this wysa can suggest some appropriate methods to overcome the problem.. Anyway this is just a siggestion:) great work guys.. !",4

"('4',)","Review Text 1810: This app has great potential,  however it's certainly missing big key points and important details. Some users may not be able to exercise due to pain,  some users may suffer from more complicated mental disorders like ptsd and some users may just want a moment to feel closer to the app by telling it about their pets. I adore the images and the quotes along with them- I've started to repeat them to myself throughout the day and even to my friends. However seeing the same few quotes for the same scenario makes them start the  lose their importance. I would heavily suggest many more to keep the mind fresh and relaxed. I know that broken record actually makes me more tense and I tend to stop taking the speaker as serious.  After a while of chatting with this app its very clear that this is in fact a program and leaves you feeling a lack of connection making it a little harder to  accept the app's advice. I want to urge the creators to continue to work on this diamond in the rough and to not leave it as is.  I have shown a few friends this app in hopes of continued development. It's only helped me a small handful of times but those were very important times and I am grateful I had a hand to walk me through it and leave me feeling grounded again. Please send updates and don't abandon us! Thank you for sending help when help is needed most. /edit/ the app also doesn't seem to understand me telling it ""good night"" or ""I have to go now"" which always leaves me feeling a little sad.",4

"('4',)","Review Text 1928: It's an okay app with helpful tips and exercises to control your mood and mind. It essentially does what it's suppose to.  Just as with any mood and mind exercises, you have to be open to it, you have to want the help, in order for it to work.  The AI chat doesn't feel like it's coddling you, which is great.

"('4',)","Review Text 1944: (11/23/2017) I used it, and didn't like it so much. To a certain extent it does help but most of the time it doesn't. It often repeats exercises and advice. As another user says, it's fixated on the idea you want to hurt yourself; only if you say key words. If you want real help and actual advice for your problems this isn't the app for you. Get help in real life. This bot can only do so much.  To the developers, this is good app, and even if I didn't find it useful I thought it was interesting on how well it caught most of my emotions. I think that the bot just needs to give better advice. The exercises are great and effective. The list, I never really understood. And the jokes need more work.

"('0',)","Review Text 1945: This app is unique and comes from a great idea, it's also amazingly friendly and calming. However, the approach is very one-sided. External factors like overwork, external stress, abusive relationships or toxic friends are not covered.

Outside of social context it's great, I think it could be good for solving anxiety or panic, internal depression etc.",0
"('4',)","Review Text 1949: It's nice for when you need help to organize your thoughts, but if you need actual help, find a chat room with real people. This is just a bot that is programmed to respond based off of key words.

"('0',)","Review Text 1969: Pros: Checks in daily. Asks you how you're feeling and what you're upto. Provides solid advice and useful information. Cons: Not even 5 minutes into it, Wysa solicits human counseling which wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't asking you to sign up for a monthly plan. Maybe offer the one time and then afterwards offer the plan if the person found the counseling helpful. Some of the responses don't translate well. Asking ""what are you upto today?"" And then replying with ""I'm sorry to hear that."" because a certain word or phrase I said prompted a sympathetic response when it didn't need one. I get it's supposed to sound like a real person but it breaks the immersion and feels impersonal. Lastly, everytime I open the app for check ins, it asks me if I want to hear about new features. If Wysa is checking in, the first thing it says shouldn't be a question about new features. Maybe wait until after the check in to mention something like that. And if the person says not now, tell them that they can type a word or phrase to Wysa find out more. It's a good app that needs minor adjustments. It's not so subtle attempts to make money off of you or make you use it more can be a little much when you're feeling blue.",0
"('4',)","Review Text 1972: This is a cute little app with nice, CANNED responses that may be helpful for some people. It's not for me though.

I am in Chronic Pain, the likes of which measure the equivalent pain of slamming one's hand in a car door as BEST DAY EVER. I am what you call a drain on the system and a burden to society. There is no ""challenging this"" for me. I am nearly always in too much pain to meet my commitments and I am constantly letting people down.

I also find the app a little buggy as it crashes  midrecording regularly and, because there are long silences, I often have  to check and see if the meditation is still running, which isn't conducive  of fully immersing myself into meditation. I've found other apps much  better.

"('6',)","Review Text 371: I'm a subscriber and I stopped using the Headspace app for six months  because I didn't like the visualization technique. It was part of most of  the packs. I don't know if it still is - I've only just started using the  app again. It really annoyed me that there was so much visualization in the  app when it's supposed to be a mindfulness meditation app. I think the  visualization technique should be an option that you get to choose (turn on  or off), or it should be a completely separate exercise on its own. To me  visualization isn't meditation because when you're visualizing you're using  your mind to think - to imagine something. Whereas meditating isn't using  your mind; it's about being present in the moment, and to me that's the  whole point of meditating! I also think the app is way too expensive and it  should be at least half the price. Most of the meditations are the same  thing being repeated over and over. And some of them are pretty useless  like the one called 'doing housework' or whatever it was. I also think  there needs to be a full body scan meditation that goes up to 20 minutes. I  realise that some of the meditations have a body scan in them but this  isn't a full one. There needs to be a full one on its own. I really like  the app and I think Andy has a great voice. I hope he continues doing the  guided meditations himself (please don't get someone else!). I just think  it's a shame about the visualization technique taking over so much of the  app. It really ruins it.",6

This is something that I really need in my life right now, but will never be able to afford the subscription. You would think with all of the complaints of how expensive the subscription is, from the majority of reviews, that something would be done about the super high costs. You could at least make more of the packs free.  I suffer from PTSD, bipolar, anxiety, and severe depression. I have tried mindfulness allow, or in groups, but it never helps. This app, with the different focus areas, and the calm relaxing voice is just what I needed. I don't remember the high subscription costs when it first came out, which shows me that since it is so popular now, they want to make more money. That is very sad. I feel like the company is just wanted to gain something off of people in pain. What ever happen to helping without wanting to just wanting to be there for someone in need.

When the yearly plan costs the same amount as my grocery bill for the week, it's just not affordable. I wish wish wish (and have emailed to ask) if Headspace would sell the packages separately instead of a subscription. I'd happily pay NZ$5-10 for the next section or package bundle, that i can then download and keep on my device, rather than being locked into a recurring billing cycle. I also think that Headspace would make more money this way. Other Apps do this (e.g. Project Life scrapbooking app) so there is no technical reason Headspace couldn't do it too. Please change this Headspace, or at least give your customers an option. Recurring billing is just too difficult for people on a tight budget, and these are the people that need your app the most!",5

As a workaround, you can fast forward to the end to avoid actually having to repeat the session in its entirety, but it's quite annoying, especially when are trying to listen without a signal and find that the session you really want to do is still locked because the app doesn't think you've completed the previous one.",0

They are well done, well explained, and the little animations are very helpful and fun to watch. Most importantly, they are pleasant to listen to. The sleep meditations have really helped me.   Cons:  The interface: It used to have a beautiful and practical interface, where you could see everything at a glance and had visual clues that helped you navigate without constantly having to read. They have changed the nice little informative icons to meaningless, uniform, and huge rectangles. You have to constantly scroll around to be able to find things and read everything due to lack of graphical cues. It is such a pity. The entire first page of the home tab is a link to the discover tab!!! The list goes on! Terrible interface!   The price: It is an extremely expensive app (100 USD a year, often with offers down to 40 USD) if you want to access all features.

A lot of people (aka most of the earth's population) do not though, and those that don't are probably more in need of it. The price makes the whole thing feel a tad disingenuous.

"('6',)","Review Text 5664: I think that Headspace is a great app for anyone trying to get into meditation or have tried to meditate before and couldn't stay dedicated due to lack of focus or an unrealistic expectation of what it is. However, I recommend just completing their free 10 sessions and just running with that whenever you need assitance or reminding of how to meditate. I have noticed that most of the meditation sessions are pretty much the same with a slight variation whether it be a longer session or just another exercise that will help you focus or stay relaxed just a little bit more. In my opinion, it's not much different than just repeating the 10 day pack. What bothers me the most about the app is it locks you out of most of the singles category. You must complete an entire pack that is related to that single to have access to it. Not only that, but the app highly encourages you to complete the whole foundation pack before moving on the other categories, and not moving to other ones until you finished another pack. As I had said before, each category is fairly similair and I feel as though this is their way of getting you to stay on their monthly subscription. This app is NOT a gimmick and truly does help those who want to meditate. His voice is very calming and guides you well, but I don't think it's worth getting the subscription unless you feel as though you want further guidance.",6

The usability is also extremely poor, going so far as outright disabling the normal navigation buttons like 'menu' and 'back', forcing you to use the awkward nonstandard in-app buttons that jump from right to left to top to center depending on what screen you are in.

Further to this, when you try to contact the app developers using email, there is no actual email address for contact.

This saddens me to know that you want to charge people to experience God on a deeper level.  Don't think He would want that.  If its all about Him I would think He would provide a way so that you would not need to charge people to go deeper with the One. which is one of the biggest problems today with the ""church"".  I get it ministries need money but why are you not trusting God to provide with your focus being to help and reach his people.  Jesus asked Peter 3 times ""do you love me "" and advised after Peter responded yes, ""then feed my sheep.""  If it's all about Jesus and not turning his house into a den of thieves why require a monthly fee.

Fourth, I can't seem to pick what I want to listen to. I see the list of plans based on subjects but I can't select. There's no warning or notification to tell me why. Or even guide on how to do it.   Finally, from the reviews I'm seeing, I'll have to pay for membership (not even sure what that entails, very poor information dissemination), with all the glitches I've listed plus what other people have experienced, it hardly seems worth it.

Sometimes I don't want to continue with the current prayer as I perhaps prefer listening to another one, but when I want to exit out of the current prayer, the app doesn't allow me to, which almost feels like it's forcing me to stay when I don't want to, which isn't the best.  I was also following a guide, and literally midway through the guide, the app did not allow me to continue and I had to pay in order to follow the rest of the guide. I was going through a REALLY hard time, and the guide was a lifesaver. However, the fact that it asked me midway through to pay (and not after I have finished the guide) made me wonder if Abide really thinks of its listeners first. I also am not able to afford the payment as my country's currency is much weaker than the dollar. I think if Abide considers its global impact more, perhaps it could make an even greater difference.",5

That being said, I would still rate the service with three stars, as it just didn't really do anything for me personally. The pace of the messaging (the therapist respond 2-3 times a day, checking in the morning and the evening) was a little frustrating to me, and I missed the rapid back-and-forth conversation from in-person therapy. Again, I admit that I can't be too critical without trying the video chat.  In the end, if you're skeptical, I'd urge you to give it a try. Perhaps wait for a good deal (I took advantage of Cyber Monday so I could try it for a month) and give it a month.

"('5',)","Review Text 713: I think the concept is really great...but... I think you should have more package options that will cost less and give people more access.  Like, for half of the current price of the small package, someone will respond 3 or 4 days out of the week. I also think people should be able to pay on a week by week basis... I may not have $150 right this moment to spend, but I might have $40 to spend for this week... and that way I could also choose to have the therapy every other week instead. Finally, I think there should be a 1 week free trial, one with no strings attached, no down payment, a week of the service for free and if I like it I'll get a package. I understand these ARE licensed professionals, and they need to make a living too. But this is also not in-person therapy, it's not proven for its effectiveness, and technological interaction is still understood. When I pay for a session with a therapist, I know that this has been effective, and I know that talking out loud to someone helps me. But I don't know if that's true for online conversation, and it's not as personal as a live session. I'm also not bound to an appointment I have to attend, I'm under my own accountability to use the app based on the money I spent and that's stressful to me, not helpful.

It is generally quick and easy to navigate, and there isn't a lot of clutter which makes existing records easy to find and read.   As good as this app is, there are a few usability enhancements which would really make this app rock: (1) Automatically save while creating a record. It's really easy to wipe out a draft record by accidentally pressing the back key on the phone. The CBT process requires a lot of effort (good thing!), so it is really frustrating when all of your hard work disappears because you hit the wrong key. (2) Make it easier to scroll through text boxes when creating a new record. Currently, the only way to scroll is to move the text cursor (not an easy task on a small phone screen). (3) Add ability to print thought records. While a mobile thought diary is great, it's hard to review the records with a therapist. It would be great if there was an easy way to print records in preparation for an upcoming therapy session.

I want this to help me but can't help but think wow, this is sort of silly.     The track limits are not useful.

It also is very much saying 'sorry broke people, we know this will make you happier, but care more about money than your emotional well being and are quite willing to rub that in your face.' It's not even particularly affordable - $5/month for a yearly subscription, $11 for monthly. There really aren't many apps on here that cost that much. If you've got the money to give, go for it. But if you're going to be bothered by being reminded at every flipping turn, on an app that is supposed to make you happier, how you don't have enough money to afford it...give it a pass.

You need to be able to use your Mindvalley account in addition to Facebook.  2. Connection /sharing between the Smartphone app and Web App is needed..  3. The ability to mix local tracks with the Omvana tracks would be awesome. This would allow a limitless variation of meditation background audio.  4.
