"('2',)","Review Text 1: I absolutely love Moodpath. I was in a very rough situation when I first  downloaded this app because I was concerned about my mental state. As I  continued to use Moodpath, I realized that it was very helpful in lettibg  me express my emotions at that moment. You're able to stop what you're  doing and take a small reflective survey throughout the day. It helps  unwind just for a little and it just helps you get through your day.",2
"('4',)",Review Text 2: Great app for keeping up with daily issues. Myself personally needs this  because of the train wreck inside my head...icant keep up with moods and  things that I need to tell my Dr. This app also describes the many  different possibilities your moods could be. Key to second guessing my  phyciatrist. 😀,4
"('0',)",Review Text 3: This app is helping me understand who I am as a person and what is causing  my depression. It gives you quick question to answer and if you show a sign  of depression then they ask how hard is it to deal with. I feel like this  app has done its research and wants the best for their user.,0
"('7',)","Review Text 4: Results were very helpful, except after the first survey it says I have a  problem with ""suicidal ideation"" because twice I said that I think about  death a lot... Even though I do think about death quite a bit and it's  pretty distressing, I never actually think about suicide and I wish there  were some way to specify this. (Edit: Thanks for reply :) )",7
"('7',)","Review Text 5: Great app! I love how it helps you reflect on past moods so you can perhaps  see what might be influencing them! Two problems (else I would gladly give  5 stars): 1: I don't receive notifications, even though I have them enabled  in settings 2: not enough emotions. Perhaps they should change daily? That  way the number stays the same, but you get a lot more opportunity to  reflect on your different emotions. Many thanks to the developers!",7
"('7',)","Review Text 6: I've been struggling with depression on and off for years, and in my head I  don't need an app like this. However after I completed the first section I  was able to use the app as a talking point with my parents, who until quite  recently had a very hard time figuring out what was going on with me and  how to help. The app is well designed and gentle with its heavy subject  matter. I'm going to keep using it both for me, and for the benefit of  those around me who love me but don't necessarily understand the struggle.",7
"('0',)","Review Text 7: It gives reminders at 7am, noon, and like 6pm, but I often feel worst at  10pm, so this doesn't get the whole picture and I can't see to find a way  to adjust the time notifications come through except the wake up time. I  also wish there were more options in the select how you feel and why you  feel that way sections. There are only like 10 positive feelings and 10  negative ones, and sometimes they don't match my emotions precicely. The  survey questions seem relevant and well set up.",0
"('6',)","Review Text 8: Been using in consistently during the past few days and gotta say I'm very  satisfied. As many comments suggest, a larger number of possible emotions  would be a good addition, however as of now it covers a good bunch. Only  things I've experienced is that sometimes i don't get the notification,  which may be an issue with my phone, and also that sometimes the entries  are recorded twice on the same time, which may affect the averaging of  results. Great nonetheless",6
"('2',)","Review Text 9: I've just downloaded this app, and so far it's been cathartic just letting  out some emotions. It's nice. It has loads of information on depression and  some other topics, and I believe that it has a lot of potential to be a  very helpful app.",2
"('5',)",Review Text 10: It's been helping me keep my stress down and things I need to do and stop  doing. Something that really made me think was the change in appetite. I  didn't think about how often I was putting off food do to stress and fear  that someone would yell at me for eating.,5
"('7',)","Review Text 11: I'm on my first day and I love it so far.

"('7',)","Review Text 66: Re-written my review after the update. I much prefer the previous style and  fewer questions. This new version seems more complicated than it needs to  be and forces you to fill in the faces before you can access the moodpath,  not great when it gets stuck in a loop asking same question.",7
"('4',)","Review Text 67: I love it! It helped me boost my mood more often than not, us using The  Secret I entered more positive moods even if not the case always &  gradually believed it which worked and right now I am grateful for my  happiness",4
"('0',)",Review Text 68: I like this app a lot. It really helps give a bigger picture. I wish there  were more emotions and experiences to choice from in the daily check in. I  often find that they don't quite represent my state so I select something  close to it but can feel like it has a different meaning.,0
"('4',)","Review Text 70: I love this app! It's been very helpful in many ways. like tracking the  worse episodes, tracking symptoms and giving information. I definitely  recommend if you are struggling and would like to keep record of all that's  gone down.",4

"('7',)","Review Text 79: **** update 6/8/18 My app started to bug where it had me answer the  questions over and over but wouldn't let me do anything else. I saw that  they fixed bugs and updated the app so it will save our data if we delete  the app. So I checked for an update, didn't have one so I downloaded it  again. Everything's gone. Makes me sad. I had 4 months of info saved. Gone.  I will continue to use the app. I wish there was a way for me to get my  info back. I dont think I ever got the option to create a log in. But I  haven't found the back up option. * I have just started my 4th session. I  really enjoy thisbe yo use the app. It's helped me calm down and focus on  my problem areas. It's like a friend thar checks in on you. I like that it  let's me ""vent"" after each mood update. It's a way for me to get my  feelings out, and most of the time it's just me being worked up over  something that actually affects me in now way. If you have anxiety, self  image issues or you feel you're depressed, this app is a great way to start  ""treating"" yourself and seeing the big picture. I love it and I think I  will use it until it cuts me off.",7
"('4',)","Review Text 81: I absolutely love it, I've been using it for a while now to track my mood  and it's really helped me understand depression more due to all the  information about it within the app.",4

"('7',)",Review Text 86: Stuck in an infinite loop. When I open the app it asks me to answer the  questions. I answer them. Then it asks again. I answer them. It asks again.  I can't get out of the loop. It won't let me into the app until I answer  the questions.,7
"('4',)","Review Text 87: Brilliant app. I'm on medications that affect my memory and this app is  great for recording regular moods and feelings, which is helpful when I see  my psychiatrist. Best mental health app in the world.",4

"('5',)",Review Text 128: It really helps me understand what is going on in my head and helps me when  I need it most,5
"('4',)","Review Text 129: The app is very nice and helped me a lot. The only thing that I don't like  is that you cannot track your mood for more than 14 days period. It would  be nice if you can see your mood progression for more time (like a month,  three months, etc.). The rest is perfect.",4
"('7',)",Review Text 131: Great app! I've been using if for more than a month and I love it. I had a  few problems with the app when I started using it but the new update fixed  everything for me. Thank the moodpath team for the lovely reply to my  previous review. I recommended the app to a friend and they're very happy  with it as well. Great job guys!,7
"('7',)","Review Text 133: I haven't yet achieved my 14-day yet, but I like that it reminds me to  check in with the notifications. Essentially, This app reminds me to  check-in with myself. How often does someone ask themselves; how am I  feeling today? What's my mood? Is this a burden to me? Etc. And the diary  feature at the end of every block is a great feature because it's a piece  to reflect on yourself. Here, it's you typing to yourself. Sounds odd to  do, but it helps you to delve deeper into yourself. Great!",7
"('7',)","Review Text 134: The app is really good, and it isn't so time consuming. The explanations  are great and the whole app is really professional. I would like a way to  like change the questions though, if you're unsure sometimes it's hard  saying yes or no to some of the questions and sometimes you get a  repetitive question in the same day. And some questions you can't give an  answer to, well you can but sometimes you don't know what to say.",7
"('7',)","Review Text 135: I love this app. The recent update that allows for tracking of felt  emotions and experiences throughout the day is nice and appears pretty  efficient. I just finished my 1st 14 day period and the result seems pretty  accurate to my feelings/symptoms. I'm gonna keep using it because it's nice  and I like being able to track my emotions/feelings. Edit: After the recent  update I seem to no longer be receiving notifications for question block  reminders. I have tried unchecking and checking the box but I haven't got  any.. Regardless I still love this app, just hard for me to remember to  check the app for question blocks.",7
"('7',)",Review Text 137: Love this app. And I especially love this new update where you add your  emotions and experiences throughout the day. It really makes it seem more  reliable. With the last update I had been going through a major bout of  depression and after the 14 days it told me I had zero depressive episodes.  Which definitely threw me off because I knew that wasn't true. So I'm  looking forward to seeing how accurate it is with this new update.,7
"('4',)","Review Text 138: I had some issues with the reminders that's why I gave it 4/5 but I think  this has been fixed. Everything else about the app is perfect, runs  smoothly, nice clean graphics, very user friendly, simple to figure out and  use daily. At first I downloaded it because I've been feeling down and was  curious to see what my diagnosis was, but now my 14 day is over and my  diagnosis is pretty spot on, I realise I enjoy and benefit from keeping  track of my mood. How about a ""pro"" version where you get more questions  about your routine (ex. Exercise, eating, hours slept, period maybe) and  graphs on a calendar to compare your mood based on your routine and  feelings. Maybe a switch on reminder to be mindful that can be customised.  I just think that this app has so much potential, I mean its #9 on medical  apps in the Google store! Good work!",4
"('4',)",Review Text 139: I really like the notifications that alert me to put my moods in. I also  like the relaxing theme of the app. The only thing that I would add is some  inbetween moods. Like you guys have the happy noods and the bad noods but I  think there needs some inbetween ones. Because sometimes people are just  moderate. But over all good app,4
"('7',)","Review Text 140: I love it. The only problem I have with the app is not being able to look  at the doctor's letter even after 20 days. It still says ""will be availible  after 14 days"", and it's a bit disappointing at this point. Haven't found a  review with the same problem. I'm really hoping for a response.",7
"('0',)","Review Text 142: I've just read my report having just completed my 14 days and can say it's  reasonably accurate - more so than I was expecting initially. About 2-3  days into using the app I thought to give it up after it's initial  assessment suggested I was 'hardly distressed' when I was feeling the total  opposite. Gave it more time and it's proven to get to know my psychological  state accurately, presented in a formal report that I would feel  comfortable providing to my GP or other health care professional. So in  all, I would recommend this app if you're not confident/comfortable seeing  a professional just yet but want to gauge your psychological frame of mind  to take on board to seek further help. I can't compare this app to others,  only to say this is not a meditation app so pass it if that's what you're  looking for.",0
"('0',)","Review Text 146: This app is amazing and it has helped so much in my therapy sessions so we  know better what subjects need to be talked about. I love the new update  with the experiences and notes because it adds so much more. However, I  gave it a 4 instead of 5 because with the new update, it seems like the  three questions it asked about your feelings and thoughts are now gone. I  feel like those were very helpful in the long run and should definitely  make a come back. They help pin point where trouble areas are. With them  gone, this is looking like some other mood tracker app. Please bring back  those questions. Also, with the new update, I am no longer getting  notifications so I'm not able to input something at each of the three times  per day.",0
"('0',)","Review Text 149: Moodpath is really a great way to check in with yourself. It reminds you to  ask yourself how you're feeling. In essence, yes, it can be a diary, if you  add detail to the notes field when asked. However, it doesn't have to be of  you don't wish it to be. It's reminded me to think about how I'm feeling  right this second, when it asks, and asks me 3 short questions about how  I'm feeling and how much that particular thing is affecting me. It's a  great app, and I'm writing this review with the app saying that I have  indications of a severe episode. I'm just glad that it gives me a more  visual way of gauging my feelings.",0
"('2',)","Review Text 150: I have a bad memory so when my therapist asks how I've been I usually can't  remember, but this helps so much! Also helps me track my manic and  depressive cycles.",2
"('4',)",Review Text 151: This is the best health based app I've used. It's allowed me to track the  symptoms of a major depression and watch daily and weekly the progression  of my moods. It's really easy to use and even provides reports for medical  professionals. Excellent app.,4
"('4',)","Review Text 152: I've only had the app for two days, but it's already helping so much! I  already know I have anxiety, OCD and depression, but being able to track my  ups and downs helps a lot. If you need to just let out or feelings or keep  track of yourself, this app is great!!",4
"('7',)","Review Text 153: As someone with chronic depression, this is what I need. I can only do so  much myself, but having someone or in this case a robot cheering you on,  and then doctors notes, omg! This is everything I could ask for! Going to  the dr is so hard, I missed my therapist appts so much this semester and I  dont know why. This is just like that, simply telling the app about your  day, then you get feedback days later so the dr can see your mood over all  those day",7
"('7',)",Review Text 154: Using it for second day. Looks interesting and well made. But can you  please allow the app to work and send notifications WITHOUT needing  Internet connection. I'm missing my periodic entries because it won't work  without Internet. I don't like leaving a connection all the time.,7
"('8',)",Review Text 155: Love the app. It has be really helpful. Only issues are the notifications  won't show up some times. Also there is no quick add shortcut or widget.  This would improve days collection allot. Thank you for making this app.,8
"('7',)","Review Text 156: I like this app. I think it's helpful and easy to understand, and I like  its simple design. A few complaints I have though are that sometimes the  app suddenly stops loading, never loading my information again, and I have  to redownload and start all over. It hasn't happened recently, but it did  happen a few times. Another complaint is that when I miss one of the  moodblocks, I can't go in and fill it with the emotions I remember. If I'm  too sad to get out of bed and check a notification, I need to be able to  document that mood after I feel good enough to get out of bed again. Having  the app entirely skip the morning, evening or afternoon doesn't exactly  help. My final complaint is the that the app sometimes doesn't send me  notifications despite me turning them on and off, restarting the app,  restarting the phone, etc. That's all I have in terms of  complaints—otherwise this app is very easy to handle and rather helpful for  me.",7
"('2',)",Review Text 158: Absolutely wonderful app. I suffer from debilitating anxiety and severe  depression and until I found this app have been too apprehensive and  nervous to ask my Dr. For help. The assessment at the end of the 2weeks  I'll get based my answers to the in depth questions everyday will be what  gives me the courage to finally ask for help. Thank you for this  tremendously helpful app.,2
"('7',)","Review Text 160: This is one of the best apps designed for assessment of mental health. I  highly recommend using it for those who are thinking about going to therapy  or those already in therapy. It helps track symptoms of depression, and it  is clearly focused on this one condition. I also enjoyed reviewing the  brief research-based explanations given in the Knowledge tab.",7
"('7',)","Review Text 162: I loved it! But after the 14 days were over it stopped sending me  notifications even though the app says the notifications are turned on, so  I forget to log in all the time. That's very sad.",7
"('5',)",Review Text 165: Ive been in a rather dark place for a while. Using this kinda felt like an  interactive diary. Something that helps me. Honestly I rarely recommend  anything but this I really do recommend. I thought it was going to be one  of those silly non researched quizzes. But its actually pretty great..,5
"('7',)","Review Text 166: This app is great! It provides seemingly accurate and definitely  professional feedback. However the notification system is very  unreliable... Lately it has been missing one of the reminders every day and  today it only reminded me once. Also, sometimes when I do complete the  questions the continue button is unresponsive, resulting in me having to  miss that set of questions. If these problems were fixed, it would be a  five star review!",7
"('0',)","Review Text 169: I am not totally sure just how accurate this site is, but it gives me  something to do and it actually is interesting. I like the fact that it  gives explanations and treatments to certain things such as depression,  even if it does make me feel a little sad about the fact that I hinesyly am  depressed",0

"('7',)",Review Text 172: This app allows you to track emotions daily and allows you to stay on top  of stress before burnout occurs. I have enjoyed using it through the past  semester of university.,7
"('2',)","Review Text 173: I would strongly recommend this app to people both with and without  depression. You don't have to do the assessment part and it is very  informative, the knowledge section is very coherent and helps me understand  what I'm going through whilst helping me understand how I can get help from  others and myself. Over all this is an incredible app although I haven't  finished my 14 days yet.",2
"('7',)","Review Text 174: This app tells you every physical symptom of depression that can happen  before you even are aware your depressed, it takes 2 weeks for your results  but it is worth the wait. Most accurate app I have found.",7
"('8',)",Review Text 175: I have been diagnosed with bipolar. This app is absolutely the best for  tracking my mood cycles and alerting me to trouble..I am going to show my  Dr. and tell her this is an amazing tool for people with mental disorders.  I intend to ask her to download it and try it for herself. I cannot thank  the people involved in the development of this app enough! Thank you,8
"('0',)","Review Text 176: I love the idea of the app and how it works. It makes tracking your mood  feel more personal and reflective. However, after the first two weeks, I  wish there was a way to continue the notifications as they were to remind  you to continue logging your mood, or have the ability to modify the  settings so you only log twice a day and when you get notified to log in.  Some people, like myself, need the extra little prompt to remind you to log  how we feel so our data intake remains consistent. If that change was made,  I would rate 5 stars Edit: 4/30 I've started a new logging period and  things are going well! However, I only get notifications for morning and  night logs, and I keep missing the afternoon log unless I go into the app  myself. Also, if it's possible, it would be nice to have the timing  consistent for the notifications. It feels like some days I'll get a  notification at 8am, and the next day it would pop in around 11am. If this  could be tweaked, this would make this amazing app all the better! Edit-  Update 5/11 One thing that I think should be offered is a way to back up  your data. I just had my phone wiped and now all of my data is gone. It's  not terrible, I had the letters saved separately, but having to restart is  a bummer. Any chance this will be changed in the next update? I still love  the app!",0
"('5',)","Review Text 177: I really love this app as it helps me to track my mindset. The accuracy with which it submits my symptoms is really rather impressive! The new UI looks pretty awesome, but there are problems with the notification and the entry timings. For example sometimes the app would notify my an hour or 2 before I can actually make my entry, and other times it wouldn't notify me all together. The app would sometimes not even allow me to make my entries. It's also become incredibly buggy now so a fix to these bugs would be really appreciated! :)",5
"('7',)","Review Text 178: The 14-day report is incredibly helpful, and the short question-based  prompts make it much easier to answer and stick with it. I would love to  see the option to add custom emotions/experiences in the future.",7

Helpful  because it's much easier to have a daily, specific list to go over with my  therapist when she asks why I'm feeling depressed, what's happened since my  last appointment, instead of struggling to remember and becoming frustrated  when I can't keep everything straight in my head.",4
"('4',)","Review Text 182: The recent update to the app made it even better. I'm not presently  suffering from depression, but the reports help me keep an eye on how well  my meds, supplements, sleep, and lifestyle modifications are controlling my  PMDD/ADHD. Mood tracking is critical for me, and Moodpath has been a great  tool!",4
"('4',)","Review Text 185: It's like a nice little checkup that helps keep track of how you're doing.  It also lets you take personal notes, so it almost just functions as a  diary. It's super helpful when it comes to letting out your emotions in a  healthy and helpful way.",4
"('8',)",Review Text 186: Anyone Suffering Emotionally should use this to help monitor themselves.  Bringing this info to my counselor or MD is amazing to have. Thank you  Moodpath!!!,8

"('0',)","Review Text 190: Amazing app, the questions are specific and frequent enough that you don't  feel like you're generalising an entire day or week into simple emotions,  it's much more complex and helps you to identify specific symptoms.  Absolutely wonderful, can't recommend highly enough",0
"('0',)",Review Text 191: It's a really good app I haven't got to my 14 day yet but I am almost  there. Answering questions and doing this everyday has actually in a way  helped me feel a little better and this is app is very professional.,0

"('0',)","Review Text 194: Another tool in my toolkit to combat PTSD from serving in Iraq. I like that  it incorporates journaling style components, information that isn't  overwhelming and a user friendly check in for how you feel in that moment.

Loved it!! 😊,2
"('7',)",Review Text 196: I just started to use it and it was so great and interesting of what is  going on to me right now. I will definitely recommend this app for people  whose going through a hard time on their self bet then the most important  one we should have first is God.,7

I really recommend it to  anyone who feels that they have depression, anxiety or anything else",7
"('0',)","Review Text 201: I think this app is really good so far, I mean I haven't reached my first  14 day period yet but it kind of helps me to really think about what I'm  feeling at the moment and how much that particular feeling is weighing me  down. This really helps me personally because for a really long time I just  pushed my emotions down. Although I dont like how the questions that are  yes and no have green and red as if to say that the red one is bad and you  shouldn't put it down, it makes me feel guilty when I answer that. Also the  feelings and activities that are separated into blue and green, the blue  ones are obviously what's supposed to be bad and that too makes me feel  awful for answering one of those, like boredom isn't always a bad thing. It  should also have a stressed option in the emotions section because that's a  regular thing and it can factor into people's mental health state.",0
"('5',)","Review Text 204: Really helps me self-reflect and talk to myself. I have not finished my 14  day cycle but it really can lift my mood from the state I put myself into.  Thank you, Moodpath.",5

"('2',)","Review Text 207: Amazing! It can accurately describe my moods. It helped inform me better of  Depression (And even Bipolar Disorder). It gave me facts and symptoms about  Mental Health, and best of all, I understand myself better. 10/10. I would  recommend to anyone, especially those who are also suffering from  Depression. This app helped me see the highs and lows in my life. It showed  me what activities made me happy, and what upset me, and therefore what to  focus on to help end my depression, it told me how to get out of my  downward spiral, and it was a big help in my life. Really, just separating  the events of my day from good and bad, seeing what went well in my day was  really helpful. (Which was a bit harder to find out rather than what went  wrong, but) when I found it, I felt better. I believe this app is  innovative, and (maybe inadvertantly) helped me count my blessings as well  as my curses, to show me there is hope. I would definitely recommend you  get this app. It is all that it says and more.",2

As of yet I cannot edit my response when the mood page comes.  2) Make the text in the textbox on the mood page larger. Some people may have issues reading it.  3) Add a little more green in the color scheme. It may help users to open up more.

It honestly feels more like a friend asking me about how I'm doing, and I almost feel like I miss it when I'm alone or feel a bit sad, like missing a friend. The clean and pretty visuals makes me calm and the ""what causes this mood?"" box feels like a mini journal to me. This app has really helped me since I don't regularly have people asking about my condition, and the fact that it has an explanation about depression is very interesting to me! Overall a very good app and I very much reccomend it to others as well :))",0
"('7',)","Review Text 403: I've been using this for two weeks, about, I'm appreciating it more and more daily.   I normally journal every day, but when I'm depressed or hypomanic, that 500 words turns into 0, or 5000. Having 3 easy questions, and notifications on my phone, and a simple rating system really helps me track how things get. It's really improved my awareness of my emotions, even if I'm not a big fan of the ""hardly distressed"" rating it gives me when I'm manic. But it's easy to look over- I know it's not checking for mania symptoms.",7
"('6',)","Review Text 404: Easy to use, it was kinda glitchy for some time but somehow no more glitches and i get notifications correctly.

"('0',)","Review Text 406: I haven't finished the 14 days yet but I am enjoying the app. I think that there should be a feature to where if you are feeling distressed you can alert the app of your feelings, because this has happened to me but I had already answered my questions for that segment and when the next block came I didn't feel as bad and the questions asked weren't how I was feeling.",0
"('4',)","Review Text 407: A great app! Its aesthetic and very clean visuals. The charts and graphs help me accurately track my moods and go back to see why I was feeling that way.  Only a few improvements could be made. During the time where it asks you three questions about your mood, I think having the option to write down a personal response to the question after selecting yes would be beneficial.  And as a few others have said increase the space to write. And possibly question not limited to depression but more general well being. Like how your job friends location and problems affect your mental health. I use this app to locate my triggers and what makes me happy so the more details the better. I plan to use this all year long and probably longer. Really you guys amazing job.",4
"('4',)","Review Text 410: Excellent app. Tracks mood daily, 3 times. Great because most mood trackers only check once per day. I feel like this is more in-depth, and I can go back and see if my mood is situational, or see if I've developed a trend and should get in contact with medical professionals. Also, has many sources about depression, how to determine if you have it, explanation behind specific terms, and treatment options. Phenomenal job! I will be recommending this to everyone I know. I can't say enough about how well this app was made.",4
"('7',)","Review Text 411: I'm not sure if any medical professionals are involved with this app but for one it feels like it, and two, it is worded and structured like the creators know the symptoms intimately.

I can't recommend it highly enough and it even surprised me with how thorough it was with certain questions, and even follow ups depending on your answers to see if you're truly ok.  That's what I took away at least. Top notch app and the creators are amazing people having done it.",7

The quick questions 3times a day, took no effort. The app picked up the warning signs of a major depressive episode, and, after a few more questions, told me I needed to call for help right away. I went inpatient that day, and got out today after a week in a behavioral health center. Life's looking a lot better now, and I'm definitely glad I got Moodpath, because I might not still be alive now without it. It really helped. Thank you.",4

At the end it gives you a full report and even a note to show your doctor. This app is a blessing. I do have two things I'd change. 1) Anger is a huge thing with my disorders so adding anger as a choice or question would be helpful for ppl like me, and if you miss an entry, to be able to go back and edit/ add it in. I write mine down if I miss it because sometimes my phone gives me bad anxiety. Minor things for an amazing app. I recommend this app! It's truly been so helpful in my daily life. Thank you!!",7

Anyways, I still love the way this one is set up; it is very easy to use.",4
"('4',)","Review Text 468: The problem with tracking depression is often that your mood stays in neutral. This style of tracking, in a straight line from good to bad, doesn't apply if you never feel good or bad.  This app would benefit from a wider range of emotions to pick, i.e. Anger, restlessness, panic, state of ennui etc. I would find it useful to know, for instance, that i am angrier in the evenings. I know this would make the app much more complicated to develop, but I feel it would paint a truer picture of individual depression.  The UI is marvelous and the knowledge section is excellently written. Everything besides the design of the mood tracking is to be commended.",4

Keeping track of what I'm feeling, along with notes as to what happened during the day allows me to see what may have triggered an episode, which in turn helps to be more realistic in what I think and do.

"('6',)",Review Text 526: This app is pretty good. I especially enjoy how it offers explanations of what you might be going through along with it's questionnaire of your current difficulties.,6
"('4',)","Review Text 527: I absolutely love this app. It has been really great helping me track my feelings and emotions and then putting together a review every 2 weeks. I am able to print them out and email them to my doctor (who prefers both methods). In the past my doctor has recommended a journal to keep on hand to write down how I am feeling throughout the day but it never works and I always forget to write in it faithfully (which is really the only way for it to work successfully). This app reminds me and has me fill out my questions 3 times a day which I think is really awesome. Are there things I think they could improve? Yes. For example, more diverse questions and more types of questions. Also I agree that my app has also been having a glitch where it sometimes doesn't alert me at the correct times. Regardless of these things I still give this app 5 stars. I am not sure how many people actually read the full reviews but if you've made it this far and have read all the above, I again seriously 100% recommend this app to any one who has any kind of mental health problem. Especially if you are wanting a way to easily track these moods to see if there is a pattern, or to see a summary of 2 weeks worth of entries, or whatever other reason. I've told so many of my friends and family about this app!",4
"('7',)","Review Text 528: I've only starting using this app today, but I already love it. The questions fully understand how I feel, and the information section is very informative and really gets to the heart of how poor mental health develops.",7
"('8',)","Review Text 529: I've been going through another episode, and for some reason this app was on my ""suggested apps"" list. Only at day 2, but I can already see how it can help. Thank you to the team for developing this app.",8
"('4',)",Review Text 530: I like the app. It asks questions that I havent considered. I think its a good way to keep track of your mood.,4
"('7',)","Review Text 531: Helps me so much and I think it was extremely accurate. To get an accurate response, you just have to answer everything honestly. This app has you answer about 5 questions 3 times a day (morning, noon, night) and gives you a progression of your mood. At the end of a 14 day period, it will have your results. These results will be easy to understand and, if needed, will come with a doctor's note (to show a doctor or therapist). It really helped me and I think it's an extremely good rescource.",7
"('6',)",Review Text 532: App is good.  Even writing answers to same question again and again is relieving stress from inwards as I'm able to dump my real feelings.,6
"('0',)","Review Text 533: This app is crucial for those that need help on how they are feeling. It gives out great information and evaluates how that person is feeling. Great app, it can be a lifesaver.",0
"('4',)",Review Text 534: I've been tracking my mood for nearly 2 weeks and I'm happy with it. The notifications pop up and it's a nice little reminder to stop and take in my surroundings. It reminds me to gauge myself and know where I am emotionally and mentally. Very excited to see where this leads.,4
"('8',)",Review Text 535: Thank you moodpath . 😊 Thanks for helping people  . I didn't understand the concept of weights. Which make us burden  . Can you please say about them that what role they play in finding one's mood,8
"('4',)",Review Text 536: this is a really good app ive been using this app for a week now and its really helped me track my moods and see how changeable my moods can be. this is a excellent app and i would recommend over all the other mood trackers out there. the helping hand and suggestions are nice like the option of a help line or counselling.,4
"('6',)",Review Text 537: Works real good except the fact that I don't get any notifications. It misses my analysis by a few days. I have to remember to open the app to log my mood. Please fix this.,6
"('2',)","Review Text 538: This is an extremely helpful app , cos it's helps u self monitor, helps with tracking down feelings and offers info on what your going through , like your own lil diary... It's great for me. Deffo would recommend getting it",2
"('7',)","Review Text 539: Beautifully designed and easy to use. Just started so I can only say that it's not tedious or bland, great for sharing with therapists, and highly effective to monitor yourself.",7
"('6',)",Review Text 540: The app is good but my younger sister usually borrows my phone to play and I'm not really comfortable in sharing something like this with her so I wish the app would have more privacy with like a password or a pin when opening it,6
"('0',)",Review Text 541: I don't like where it has only 3 times a day you can write how you feel Like maybe in the afternoon you're feeling really good but a few hours later you're down in the dumps or the other way around Other then that its really useful I like it its easy to use and the notifications aren't overwhelming,0
"('5',)",Review Text 542: It works really well since I'm having problems with deppression and anxiety. Overall it's nice.,5
"('7',)",Review Text 543: Not finished yet but I am a big fan so far. Answering the questions takes  about 30 seconds total and the reminders are great.,7
"('6',)","Review Text 544: I really liked the ease of use and straightforwardness of the questions. As someone that works overnights, I think customizable schedules are very important and possibly taking into account sleep schedules, since amount of good sleep can decipher how one feels at any given moment.",6

"('4',)","Review Text 551: A great app to keep u aware of your feelings, moods and possible patterns behind them. It can also be a great tool to help with therapy. My counselor was intrigued but it was too soon to share.",4
"('5',)",Review Text 552: Really great. I tend to forget to answer the questions but it is really a  thoughtful app to have. It makes you feel like someone cares.,5
"('4',)",Review Text 553: This is first review on any app . I was actually very shy to talk to doctor of what I'm going through they just wouldn't understand it and assume it is because of my teenage but I knew what I was going through . Mood path took a role as a doctor nd tracked my daily mood nd had questions which was exactly what I felt . I'm glad I found this . I got my report nd I'll show it to my doctor next time . Thank you,4

"('4',)",Review Text 562: It's quite amazing.. let's us know our mood and also helps to tackle depression. Love it 😊,4
"('6',)",Review Text 564: It's a good app for monitoring depression but problem I have is I made a mistake on one of the questions and can't go back and change it.,6
"('0',)","Review Text 566: it's a great way to monitor your mental health, I'm a bit iffy on the way it reminds to input how you're feeling cuz I could feel one way while answering the question but than another right after",0

"('7',)","Review Text 569: Even if it is simple, it gives deeper meaning in your life just by asking you questions (Blocks). It is also free of charge AFAIK. So yeah, Its a neat little app to understand your life better.",7
"('6',)","Review Text 570: I just started using this app. The initiation sounded good and really took  my interest. May the final result help me to come to a better self  understanding. However, I found addition psychological information erudite.",6

"('0',)",Review Text 573: Since I've gotten this app I feel like I can actually start to handle my anxiety and depression especially on days where it is difficult to function.,0
"('5',)","Review Text 574: This app asks you 3 series of questions each day for 14 days, after that it  gives you some sort of diagnosis and tells you to seek medical help.  There's nothing more to it than that, really. My advice for anyone reading  this would be to get actual help from a psychologist/ psychiatrist, this is  in no way a replacement for it. Also if you're looking for a journal app  this one isn't specifically made for that imo.",5
"('7',)",Review Text 575: It asks questions that I wish people actually asked me and now I'm worried about my mental state.,7
"('0',)",Review Text 576: I like it a lot. When I'm alone and feeling really bad it helps me kinda refocus on the main goal,0

"('4',)",Review Text 581: Not finished the 14 days yet  I hope it will still be free and carry on helping me to keep track of my mood after that. I like it. Like others have said it kind if feels like a friend asking how you are. I haven't yet written in the 'journal' section yet as I'm probably paranoid about where that info ends up. Just from a vulnerability perspective. Where does it go? I like the info that you guys have put on there too. I think some links to different sources that could help with these things. For example the CBT page could have a link to an article or a how to video on YouTube.,4
"('7',)","Review Text 582: It's great, but I can't access my overview and doctor's letter even after I've completed the full day survey. Is there anyway to fix this? Thanks!",7

"('7',)",Review Text 928: The information section is easy to understand and informative. The text is also big and paragraphs are small with big spaces between making it easier to read. The questions and the ability to see your progress and acrue more data for a more conclusive look at your depression is very helpful. I think it would be nice to have more questions. The same 10 or so questions get boring after a while. Otherwise this is a really good app. I like it a lot.,7

"('0',)","Review Text 942: I really love the idea of the app and the knowledge available for it, however I was ultimately disappointed. I think for some it may be a fantastic choice, but as a person with functioning generalized anxiety disorder and random but sudden bouts of depression, this app failed me.  I really like that it checks in throughout the day, but wish it offered more time as I ended up missing some of the question blocks and doesn't seem to tack on extra events at the end of the two week period to make up for it so you're left with missing data. It also requires an Internet connection, which was problematic as I went out of town and had no reception or Internet and missed several days. I made a mistake in one of my entries and there seemed to be no way to go back to change it. I also wish you could specify the times as my depression hits late at night, long after my last batch of questions for the day. I think the questions should be adjusted slightly, to specify ""currently"" as in, ""are you CURRENTLY feeling like this?""   I suffer from generalized anxiety disorder with some depression on the side and was advised by my psychiatrist to try to track my mood while we attempt medication. Again, while a great idea in theory, ultimately the app failed me as it says that I'm fine, and as ""normal"" as the rest of society. I know this isn't the case and that I just happen to be high-functioning which is how I got to the point I am at now with random and sudden mood changes which before I had no explanation for. I would always compare myself to others who had deep-rooted depression and, recognizing they had it much worse, made excuses for why I was feeling how I did. But that's what they were. Excuses.  BOTTOM LINE, this app is meant to be a guide and may not work for everyone. There are many forms of anxiety and depression, and if you feel off, sad, or overwhelmed consistently, please see your doctor.",0

It doesn't push for things though, it reminds you but it doesn't take long to fill out some quick things when you have some free time. It's actually a really good app, I haven't really had problems with it yet",4
"('8',)","Review Text 1102: I appreciated when the app opened up a chat window to ask me if I was okay after selecting Yes for ""thinking about death"". I was asked if I wanted to be connected with a help-line (is that the proper term?) and was respected when selecting ""No Thanks"" and was given contact numbers in case I changed my mind. Most sites or apps or even some PEOPLE wouldn't care to that extent or know to offer that kind of help in that same situation. I am giving this app a rating of 4 Stars since I agree with some that there should be an option to change your mood in case of accidental selection, and also to have it optional to add more moods than just the manditory 3 per day.

Use this app on a regular basis and, after some time if you are being honest and forth coming with your daily assessments, you will start to notice trends in your mood and behavior. You will also be made aware of people, situations, or concepts that significantly alter your mood.   What you do with the information is up to you, but in the very least you'll have learned a great deal of things about yourself that you either didn't know or hide too well from yourself that it rarely surfaces.",4

Otherwise, so far so good. I hope this helps me to track my mood more easily than other apps with way too many options or features. I also like the informational aspect.  Update: everything is great. The only issue i have is that the reminder is not attention-grabbing enough, so i often miss a morning or afternoon entry, since there is a limited time period to fill out of. The option of full screen reminders or something of the short, might make it less easy to neglect accidently. However, i haven't missed a while day a single time. I'm looking forward to the feedback i will get from the doctor's letter, etc. Once the survey period ends.

Your final customized report that is meant to be shared with both your GP (family doctor) and your psychologist/psychiatrist/social worker/counsellors is quite useful in opening up the pathways of communication and eliminating stigma that unfortunately still surrounds mental illness today. This app was much better than most other similar psych apps I've downloaded and tried out, that's for certain!!! If you're someone who suffers from ANY type of depression, or think you may even be at risk, I definitely recommend that you download this app, work your way through the daily 3x check-in where you respond to simple emotions and mood related questions and add in a sentence or 2 about how you feel at the time and why, explore the many different categories of psych questions and attempt to answer them (don't worry about getting the answers right or wrong - there's no scorecard here - plus the app provides you with the detailed correct response and an explanation thereof along with some examples.

Do something art, programming, modeling, editing, sewing, studying whatever satisfies you. If you are bad at studies get help as soon as possible. Dont remind yourself stay away from those who reminds you of yourself(headphones can deal with the backbiting). Nobody is perfect. Look at the glass half full not the opposite way.

The developer really deserves not just five stars but ten stars. It's really helpful. It made me feel better. I'll continue exploring the entire app.,5
"('4',)","Review Text 126: The app has helped me become aware of my moods throughout the day.  Why is this important? It helps me identify thoughts that have given me the poor moods or the amazing ones.  The app also has many other tools.  You can track daily goals and focus on a purposful life.  Also,  it has guided meditations to relieve stress and anxiety.  The app is amazing if you utilize it to its fullest potential.",4
"('6',)",Review Text 127: All in all it's a pretty good app it helps me understand and identify thought traps that bring me down and the mediation helps so much also being to post quotes and many other things this app has a lot of good qualities.

"('7',)","Review Text 128: Very integrative app, much better than all the others I've tried. It's  snuck it's way into my life and I find myself looking forward to checking  in like never before. The new pod casts are great too. I highly recommend  just paying for the subscription. It's worth it and you can't even visit a  shrink once for the same price as a year's subscription.",7
"('4',)","Review Text 129: Really love this app, especially how it allows you to record mood and track  negative and positive habits. Am really tempted to upgrade as I'd like more  open access to the meditation library but am concerned with the quality,  especially regarding the ""peaceful soundscapes"". The clipping (few seconds  of silence) that occurs around every two minutes is so awful it disrupts  any focus and calm that I've been able to move towards in my meditation. I  still use other mediation apps, in order to avoid this, but can't see  myself upgrading until this is remedied.",4
"('7',)","Review Text 130: I love the potential of this app, but tbh it frustrates me often bc the background sound that is so useful in calming me often cuts out and stops playing randomly... I'll be in the middle of a meditation and suddenly the sound will stop and all I can hear is the voice. Then my anger bubbles up and the meditation becomes pointless bc I'm too let down to relax. I only paid for a month and was considering a year but this is too upsetting for me bc it happens far too often, so I will likely go back to the free version until this bug is fixed.",7
"('7',)","Review Text 131: I have only been using this app for a week now, but it has done wonders to  help my mental health! I am going to purchase the full app, but you  wouldn't even have too because the content in the free is spectacular!  Thank you for providing this service!",7

"('7',)","Review Text 137: Unlike many meditation apps, this one also asks you to actually deal with  negative emotions and includes CBT thought exercises. Using it for a few  days was like a good therapy session, and involved digging more than just  ""think positive!!!"" affirmations.",7
"('0',)","Review Text 138: This is the first app ive used constantly. It doesnt feel patronising and  you can tailor the functions even without fully purchasing the app. Its  nice to look at my ""mood"" chart as it really does help me figure out what  triggers me and how I can cope with that. The meditation function help me  feel calm and ready to take on whatever it is for the day. Hope this helps.",0
"('0',)","Review Text 139: I use this to keep track of my days. When I'm particularly anxious or irritated for several days in a row, the daily feelings tracker is really helpful with organizing thoughts and pointing out common feels over time.   Since I am notorious at journaling, (forgetful or I just don't bring it with me) I like how this app pings me randomly in the evenings and reminds me to enter in a bit of info about how I'm doing.",0
"('7',)","Review Text 140: Awesome meditation and calming techniques.

"('5',)","Review Text 143: Love this app!! Really helped me to learn how to shut off and to free my  mind to just not think for a while. Great that you can try a new premium  meditation every day. Only thing that annoys me is that the background  noise on the meditation, such as the ocean waves, is sometimes too loud and  I can't hear the voice over. Other medication apps have options where you  can turn the voice up or down and then the background up or down - feel  like it needs this! Often find myself listening really hard because I can't  here what's being said! That breaks concentration sometimes.",5
"('7',)","Review Text 144: Greatly helps me with managing my stress and anxiety! This app checks in on you to see how you're feeling, and depending on the emotions you put, it will recommend what to do to manage it or how you can meditate. Would live to see more features in development soon!",7

"('7',)","Review Text 273: Very helpful app that provides encouragement and goal-setting. The community definitely helps, it feels good to know I am not alone. I like that every day the app offers a premium feature for free. The relaxing exercises are a little stereotypical (with the relaxing voice saying relaxing things, you know the kind), not sure how effective they are (it could just be me). All in all, a very useful app if you need some encouragement and positivity to get yourself out of dark thoughts/feelings. Definitely recommend.",7
"('6',)","Review Text 274: I love this app, as i have a lot of mental health problems and suffer greatly.  but it cant reach its full potential on me (cant get premium) because i am on very low income (i receive disability payments).

The only complaint I have is that as someone recovering from anorexia, there's not much in the way of helping people with Ed's, but for anxiety and panic and phobic and personality disorder s I think it's extremely helpful!  It's by far the best app I've ever found for helping me with my anxiety disorders and my panic attacks!",2

"('0',)","Review Text 292: I like this app for mood tracking and journaling. It's simple and intuitive with the exception of the feelings list. There's an extremely long list of feelings to choose from, which is helpful, but I wish there was a way it was organized. It's just scrolling and scrolling through hundreds of feelings.",0
"('4',)",Review Text 293: Its easy to fall into the trap that if something negative has happened recently to think that that's the way things have been going consistently.

Pacifica reminds me of a gentle loved one, trying to calm me down.

Writing stuff down really helps me strive for it, and I looovvvee this app 💙 I recommend it very well",7
"('0',)","Review Text 298: This app is phenomenal, i dont even have the subscription but if you can afford it i recommend you buy the premium. By using levels and achievements it creates a really good incentive to complete those basic tasks that someone with mental illnesses might not feel motivated to do like meditate, excercise, or even simplty taking a shower. I loooove this cause it makes me change my own mentality by making me explain to myself what ways my thinking is flawed",0

"('7',)","Review Text 521: Absolutely wonderful. I have been struggling for years to get my anxiety and depression under control and have never been able to do so. I downloaded this app just to see if it could help. I had the free version for less than a week and I just had to get the one year subscription. It is worth every penny. The guided meditations did more than just help me to focus and relax, but helped to just breath properly. The guided paths are useful and I think will help anyone who doesn't know how to use the app at first. The app is quite easy to use and doesn't take much time to get the hang of it. I have gotten so much of our the group chats. They are filled with understanding and caring people just like me. So much support to be had there. The health tracker is probably one of my favorite features because I have a difficult time remembering to take care of myself and everyday I check my health tracker to make sure I am doing what is best for me. You can also set reminders in case you forget. The thought journals are particularly useful because it helps me to see all sides of every problem and not only that, but it helps me to take away the negative and replace it with something positive. Whoever created this app really had people's best interests in mind and I am so glad that I found this. This is such and amazing tool and I can't see myself never not using it again! I would recommend this app to anyone who is looking for guidance and support.",7

"('7',)","Review Text 557: I like this app overall, though it is a bit hard to figure out how to use in some instances.  What it is missing, in my opinion, is the ability to rate an emotional charge when you first start off looking at the emotions and distortions. Then being able to rate the charge afterwards to see if your discovery of the distortions has decreased the charge. If it had that it would feel nearly perfect, and I'd probably plug down the money for a subscription.",7

"('4',)","Review Text 562: An indepth, well thought out and we'll put together tool for tackling anxiety, stress and depression. Not only does it track a variety of measurements relating to mood, etc, it does so much more from educating the user on key CBT principles to providing well produced meditation and relaxation exercises.",4
"('7',)","Review Text 563: This app was amazing, but now it's just getting repetitive with no new goals to aim for since I maxed out on the levels I needed to work on. The meditations get old after awhile due to the same voice and the same intro every single time! It's not as rewarding as it used to be.",7
"('6',)","Review Text 564: Lovely, guided CBT goal-setting app for health, meditation, anxiety, etc. Low transaction costs for people who are busy or don't like/can't afford professional therapy. Like talking to yourself and getting good advice back. 😊",6

"('7',)","Review Text 573: My therapist recommended I try Pacifica. I did and ended up loving it. Though, I will admit to feeling odd using the forums and chat groups. Not that the groups themselves are bad per se, more that I often feel like the senior citizen. But that happens on most forums.  The meditations, hopes, mood scoring are spot on. Having a diary option has even made my therapy appointment more effective. Now my therapist and I have more specific areas to work on instead of me trying to summarize everything from our last appt. Overall Pacifica is the best CBT/Mental Health app I have ever used.",7

This app is like having all of the best mental health resources right in my pocket.  It's very intuitive and has a great guided path to show you through the different functions. Everything it teaches is in line with what I have learned from mental health professionals in all different settings.  It makes things like CBT and thought records and goal setting so easy to do and so much more practical than putting pen to paper.  My favorite function is being able to set daily habits and track how well I kept up with them as well as how that affected my mood.  I wish I could put more than 5 stars.",7
"('7',)","Review Text 636: Hi, quite like the new interface but PLEASE restore exercise as one of the suggested activities after mood check. That hope thing replacing the exercise option is not the same... and please restore the changes in suggestions based on one's energy levels, too.",7
"('7',)","Review Text 637: Initial versions of this app needed improvement and those changes were made.  The developers were very responsive to user suggestions, as well. I found the groups idea to work in theory, but strange to participate in. Consequently the more  customized the app became, fewer bug fixes and updates. I tried all the suggested fixes, but for me  the website has been frozen for months. In spite of the benefits of this app, I for one will not renew my paid subscription",7

"('8',)",Review Text 640: This is such a great cute app. I love playing but I have one problem at the moment. The ads are taking up far too much of the app. I mean they are now putting ads into the actual scenes!  Srsly!  There are 3 large emeralds on the floor of the set to switch back to the ad if I tap them accidentally.  Please curb the ads cause it will hurt all the thought you put into this app and that will mean people leaving and or giving lower ratings. Thanks.,8
"('7',)","Review Text 641: Anyone who is suffering and needs to get themselves back up again should use it...just please download it and have a look at the free content and then decide if you want to get the full version. I know most people will have doubts about an app being able to help with anxiety and depression, but it's worth just taking a look before you decide. I say this, because this app has made me feel so much better within myself. It's no cure for sure, but it's a big push in the right direction.",7

"('7',)","Review Text 662: Excellent app. The only problems are that there could be a larger library of meditations and that they think the Republic of Ireland is part of the UK. Seriously guys.

"('4',)","Review Text 663: This is a great app for tracking your moods and logging thoughts and feelings. I can only rate the free activities, which were fairly good. I used one during an anxiety attack and I calmed down very quickly. The app is easy to use and looks nice, is very discreet on your phone if that's what you want. I've been using it for over a year now and love it. My only criticisms are that a lot of the good meditations aren't free and that the app doesn't have too much in the way of HELPING with your mental health. It more or less only tracks it.",4

"('7',)","Review Text 666: I enjoy many of Pacifica's features and believe it to be a great tool for those learning about CBT and mindfulness.  I am, however, disappointed that an app asks for $6/month is overpriced and unsympathetic to those who experience anxiety already and are in need. Money may not be an issue for a certain people, but having a monthly payment fee for the majority is counter-intuitive.",7
"('4',)","Review Text 667: This app has been tremendously helpful. My mood disorder is heavily influenced by my life behaviors and habits.

Nothing else seems to get me out of that horrible depressed ""FUNK"" that I manage to get into sometimes like this app does. The thought reframing   makes me see things in a different light, and when I see just how flawed my thoughts actually ARE... it just somehow lifts that black cloud of depression off of my HEAD, and I can see and feel the LIGHT again! :) Thanks, Pacifica, for this most WONDERFUL APP!",7

I also like the aspect of having my therapist and psychiatrist monitor my progress as well. I also like the idea of the goal system,  gives me something to strive for whether it be a big or small goal. The idea of being able to reach out to other people and support those who have been impacted with depression and anxiety like me makes me feel like I'm not alone.

I purchased an app just to transfer the information and save as a cvr. This app beats the app I purchased hands down. And even the basic, unpaid membership is beyond my expectations. For those familiar with CBT and DBT this is a good investment and addition to your treatment. My doctor recommended this app. Try the app you wont regret it! :)",4

"('4',)","Review Text 820: Price is a bit much for what it does, but with the mental health month discount I took the plunge and have enjoyed the app despite some sluggishness and crashes, it has inspired me to look deeper into my thought process and accomplish goals by writing them down and keeping track. The daily health chart is nice but not scientific, you can track anything from sleep, to marijuana usage that day to bathing or assigned your own but it just adds up to a general ""health"" of how you did that day without any other integration, I would like to see the health system expanded and have suggestions as the mood board does when you post that you're in a negative mood. Also would like to set maximums, I oversleep sometimes and when I enter that into Pacifica 10 plus hours is giving me a positive grade when it really shouldn't. Also would love to see integration with other apps such a fit it and others to provide more robust analytics.",4

"('7',)","Review Text 889: This app is great for tracking my moods over long periods of time so I can be the best version of myself. With Pacifica, I can do several things: 1) become aware of the most common stress triggers in my life through journaling 2) acknowledge what methods of self care worked best in different situations & 3) take the appropriate actions for improving my life without feeling like a burden to others. Having a bad day is normal, but if you are struggling with depression/anxiety, we soon consider bad days to become the regular... no one has to live like that and this app is great for talking care of yourself, especially when stigma about mental health makes it hard to ask for help.",7
"('0',)","Review Text 890: Very helpful, I use it several times a day. I even mentioned it to my therapist so she can check it out. I really like that it checks in with you now and then to see how you're feeling and it gives you actions to take to improve your mood of you're not feeling well.",0

"('7',)","Review Text 904: The only CBT/mindfulness app that worked for me. I am doing all the exercises and helps enormously - almost like a real practitioner. And I have a panic disorder.  Areas to improve would be a better dashboard to analyse your stats and the exercises done.  I am very very keen to find out wether you plan to localise the app in the Russian language. Unfortunately, a massive Russian-speaking community doesn't have enough information online about CBT and it is not widely practiced. If only I could share this great app with my friends and family!",7
"('7',)","Review Text 905: Really awesome CBT and mindfulness app! I used CBT before this app by find it a lot more convenient with all these different tools laid out. I feel CBT might even be better to do on your phone as you go as it really gives you the chance to monitor the thoughts as they happen. This app is well designed, I would say I'm still figuring out how to use a couple of the features but for the most part this app does a great job explaining them. I will pay for the extra features if I can truly stick with this for a month or so, I think it'll be worth it! I even did a social anxiety meditation before a social gathering today - very nice touch. If you are having trouble w/ the CBT of this app I would suggest reading more about CBT to go along with the app as opposed to giving up altogether. It is helpful!",7
"('4',)",Review Text 906: It's very intuitive and insightfully designed.  A great way to track mood. You get out of it what you put in. There are a lot of very helpful free resources and when I've made my way through all of that I'll be purchasing the full thing. Very excited about this app.,4
"('7',)",Review Text 907: Such a great motivational tool; I've been telling everyone I know about it. I especially like the health bar heart and the goal setup - it's like a to-do that's actually good for me instead of stressful! Pacifica is doing a great thing here.,7

"('0',)","Review Text 913: This app is one of the best apps I have used that help me identify my feelings and help me check up on my progress to see if there is a pattern in why I feel a certain way. I love the groups that they have. The only suggestion that I want to make is to possibly make group codes linkable in the comments, instead of copying and pasting or writing it down to punch in that specific group code. But otherwise they really put an effort in making this app enjoyable.",0

I don't really like the new layout but that's personal choice. Also a shame they've removed the standard 'thought' log, now it forces you to go down a route rather than being able to log a simple thought. Sort of removed an outlet for some people but I guess some others will benefit from the change. Will re-review after I get a chance to try out the rest when it works again...",7

Health helps me to 'gamify' my day to day by trying to reach the targets I've set myself for things like water consumption and sleep length, and that's helping me to stay motivated and on top of things.

You can also write what factors are causing your mood.   There are then three additional components: Relax, Goals, and Thoughts. All of them are great! The meditations really do help you to relax, the goals let you feel achievement, and the thoughts section teaches you to see things in a more balanced and positive light.  There is also a health bar that you customize for what is important to you. It is true that when you meet more of the components, you are happier!

"('7',)","Review Text 1678: I love the design and layout of this app, on top of its function. I won't dive into that as others have covered, but it's missing something.  Say I get depressive, and a racing mind keeps me occupied. The last thing on my mind would be to record that I'm in a bad mood.   As a result, I could have had a bad day that I forgot to record. The problem is that I can't go back and enter them in the next day. This makes the progress page seem less accurate so I don't rely on it. Would like that freedom fix it.",7

"('7',)","Review Text 1727: I've never stuck with a mood tracker this long because they've always been inconvenient or complicated (i.e., inviting overthinking).

"('4',)","Review Text 1731: I find this app helpful for keeping track of what I'm doing with myself- it's definitely one of the features I use it most for. But I don't really agree with how the sleep reporting works. There's an option for if you slept 10+ hours, which I do almost every day. When you check that option it labels it as a green, or good, thing. As a hypersomniac I think it would be more appropriate if this were marked as a bad thing. It's definitely not healthy.",4
"('7',)",Review Text 1732: Pacifica has been great in helping me manage my stress and curb negative thoughts. Some of the groups are welcoming too. The only thing I don't like is the fact that nobody really makes an effort to connect with others despite the fact that we all share a lot of the same problems. Those looking for friends may not find this to be the best app for that.,7

"('7',)",Review Text 1741: I've always struggled with depression and anxiety and would regularly take medicine. I always felt like I was doing 0% progress due to seeing no results. With this app it helped me watch my habits to see what cause me distress most of the time and what makes me happy. The chats are nice but very awkward at first due to not knowing how to start. After only two days with the app I shared it  with a friend who also had depression and she loved it as much as I did.,7

The last thing you need when you're down is something that requires effort and motivation to use.

"('2',)","Review Text 5: The app itself is pretty buggy on my phone, with the sliding motion between  the chats and the notification page getting stuck multiple times. The  content of the app is extremely helpful, and the listeners are very  empathetic. They are friendly, but professional. It has helped me a lot.  Thank you for creating a platform where we can seek emotional help!",2
"('7',)","Review Text 7: The app is user friendly, overall, though I have noticed a few issues as a  Listener. The notifications are still infrequent for me, which is  incredibly frustrating when trying to show attentiveness and empathy to a  member if I'm unaware they have even replied to a message for a decent  amount of time. I generally only talk to two to four members consistently  and they are used to me being on my computer and quick to reply so slow  responses on my phone tend to cause me to seem as though I'm disinterested,  which is far from the truth.... That's my only complaint, though. Other  than that, the app works great when not at home.",7
"('2',)",Review Text 9: This app is absolutely amazing! It heals me and helps me with my anxiety  and depression. Its hard when people say to stop being a wimp and that  theres people out there with real problems when you have thoose problems.  It feels nice to vent everything out for once.,2

I even went to the anxiety help and people who are apparently able to help.  Nope. Besides that, when people do respond and know how to help, it works  great.",2
"('2',)","Review Text 16: This was my first time using this app and i can honestly tell you these  listeners helped me alot more than people involved in my life could. Now,  obviously, i can't speak for everyone and yeah, maybe some people didn't  find this helpful, but i'd at least recommend you trying this out if you  feel like you have no one else to talk to because honestly they're amazing  and do not judge you at all! Thank you 7 Cups, you really did help me more  than i thought! :))",2

"('3',)","Review Text 41: Nice app. Still new to it but I find the Growth Path very calming to go to  when I begin to get anxious or stressed. The bot, Noni, is also very  comforting when I feel too scattered to speak to a Listener.",3
"('2',)","Review Text 42: So far it's been a real help. Sometimes the chat is a little to crazy to  keep up with. I like the concept, it has helped me to get through some  tough days.",2
"('3',)","Review Text 43: Hi! I downloaded this app a couple days ago to help with my anxiety,  depression, and loneliness. So far I think it has been helpful. However,  there are a few things that I think might help the app be more useful. One  the app has a tendency to glitch and get stuck easily, so that needs to be  fixed. Two, maybe there should be an option to select listeners by  timezone. A lot of listeners are overseas and it makes it difficult to to  have a full conversation because of time differences. Three, during the  chat with the bot, I think people should be able to choose more than just  one issue to talk about at a time. Anxiety and depression often go  together, so maybe ""anxiety and depression"" should be an option for that,  along with having each option still separate. Those are the only problems  that I have with the app so far. Otherwise, it's great!",3
"('3',)","Review Text 44: I believe 7 cups is amazing! It's really nice when you have a listener help  you with find a solution to a problem you may have in life, or just simply  to tell them your story of life.",3

"('3',)","Review Text 47: Good for those who are genuinely interested in talking with someone for  purposes of comfort or comforting. You could also pay for a licensed  therapist but I recommend trying out Listeners (""regular"" people who even  have the option of learning tips and tricks in HOW to listen, and you can  check if they've taken the ""course"" or not, if necessary). There are group  chats as well as one on one chats. If you need advice, comforting, a little  bit of a vent, whatever, I can see this being beneficial for you. Just  remember, everyone is just as Human as you on the other side of the chat  box and if for any reason a Listener doesn't work out for you on the first  tries... try again if you are willing. On a personal note: be open and  steer positive.",3

"('3',)","Review Text 55: This is 7 Cups of Tea, a revolution and good use of tech to improve the  life of people. People who complain aboit their issues talking listener  don't understand neither 7 cups nor themselves, stop complaining about  listener FREE work and do more (free) work to improve your health, that  will also make you discover the appreciation you're lacking. Become a  listener yourself, cause empathy is a part of the path!! You'll want  consider the need of a certified therapist if ""you've lot to talk about"",  so work your way with a listener, save money and earn to to pay for a  therapist, they've certified good therapist on 7 Cups itself. If you want  to compare a therapist to a everyday joe (who want to help since they are  going through your same problems, but that isn't and neither claim to be a  therapist), you're are a moron. If you need, get a therapist, and talk also  a listener, they're really good people with good empathy who do their best  to help. Guys: there are specialized websites reviewing e-counseling, go  read 7 cups reviews there, not on Google Play. Adminstration: please  improve the app, compared to the website, it just sucks, it's a new app but  you can and you work hard to make it better, we all know. New members:  patience, and if it feels awkward, you're doing it right (quote from  Laura). I've really issues talking to listener, but I complain about me  first, then the listener (pro tip). Also, realizing this, talking about it  with the listener and realizing they understand me, made it so much better  to accept and start dealing with it. Stop reading reviews and get started  on your journey, you won't ever regret it.",3

I love how you get trained to be a listener instead of just jumping on and giving therapy that might not be the best. It also walks you through a mock chat, and guides you through the real thing. I also appreciate how licensed therapists are available, so i can easily direct clients in greats amount of emotional stress to them so the situation can be handled professionally. Overall, this app is amazing and i plan on staying a while and maybe becoming a licensed therapist one day (: 10/10 recommend.",7

"('3',)",Review Text 785: 7 cups is an amazingly supportive online community. There are many different features but their biggest draw is that you can anonymously connect with a listener over IM. I've found this to be a useful outlet and have received compassion and support when dealing with the harder part of life. 7 cups is on a mission to make the world a more compassionate place. It's a great website with a decent app.,3

"('7',)",Review Text 811: This is an amazing app. It is definitely worth downloading especially if you are dealing with mental health whether it be severe or minor. It definitely has its flaws. For the past 2 years I have been struggling to deal with my problems and mental health. This app had gave me more motivation to start changing my life and think positively.  I have a lot to say about this app but I will keep this review short. I would recommend this mostly to those between the ages of 11-25 though it can help anybody. Would definitely recommend this app.,7
"('1',)","Review Text 813: This is great. I have had many issues with myself as well as my friends and this has helped me solve those problems so much. Very helpful, I highly reccomend you use this if you need support with an issue, or just simply want to talk to someone caring.",1

"('7',)","Review Text 816: The website is great! The concept, where people can connect with other people is awesome too. Not to be taken as a social networking site, but the app lags too much.

"('3',)","Review Text 822: Good app to talk with nice people, just wish listeners had a more annoyingly extensive training course so that it weeds out the jerks or trolls. Also, the bot is annoying. Tips and advice from the bot should be given anytime on an advice or help section, separate from the chat itself.",3
"('7',)",Review Text 823: 7 cups is an excellent community. Supportive and allows you to connect on a deeper level with absolute strangers. The app could do with an upgrade though- there are bugs and the chats get hung up sometimes. Overall I love the concept.,7
"('7',)","Review Text 825: The website is absolutely brilliant, a great tool for those who need to get issues off their chest. However, the app could do with some improvements. For example, access to everything on the website would be beneficial. Also, the app does crash frequently.",7
"('7',)","Review Text 826: Don't spend money on this app. I waisted so much on this and it's all the same stuff. It doesnt personalize to you if you pay, it does all the same stuff as when it's free. I waisted money I could've spent on medication because we thought it would help me.",7
"('5',)","Review Text 832: I actually loved this app, it's just that this app has so many glitches.

"('5',)","Review Text 834: Skeptical at first,  but it really does help to have someone to 'vent' to. Sometimes all you need is a sympathetic ear to get it off your chest,  this app provides that aand then some",5

"('6',)","Review Text 859: Fantastic, the app could use a bit of work because when I hit the tool bar sometimes it won't let me close it and I have to exit the app. Otherwise its good, I wish there was like a separate text thing you could for like if you met another member in one of the communal chats so you could keep in touch with them. I don't think you can, you can just follow them. Also you should be able to search for particular members. But none of these things are biggies. The app is fantastic, mostly everyone is kind and compassionate and easy to relate to. Good job",6

"('7',)","Review Text 862: Great app. Could you add anger problems or IED to it please. I was unsure what to define myself as, so please add this subject. Great support though!",7
"('1',)","Review Text 865: The app does exactly what it says: it gives the user the ability to talk to someone who is willing to listen. I especially like the fact that the user can go back to the same listener, if desired, which is great, as some people need to build coonections with someone who will likely be privy to very personal things. Talking to listeners is absolutely free, while the user must pay to talk to a licensed therapist. I would recommend getting a therapist, elsewhere, though, because the user may only switch therapists, once, and I know some people may need to go through several, before finding the right one. On a personal note, 7 cups seems to be working on a chat bot to act as a listener, as well. I'm excited, as I realized I don't really like the idea of reaching out to anonymous strangers, and I feel more comfortable talking to an AI, than a human. I'm hoping the bot will offer much more than Wysa does.",1
"('7',)","Review Text 866: love this app! some feedbacks: - i'd be better if when we click the forum notification, it directs us directly to the said post, not to the last page of the thread. - there should be an option to 'bookmark' or 'save' a conversation with a listener. i'd like to remember the important points i have missed during the whole conv - it'd be nice if there is an option to delete a notif/alert or let it stay even after it's seen.",7

The people on here genuinely want to get help. Or they want to help.",3

"('6',)","Review Text 1190: Good app, one on one. In group chats though people are bullied. First instance I saw someone was going to commit suicide and accidentally spelled a word wrong so almost everyone started to harass them about the grammar mistake. Starting insulting him and his intelligence, then told me it was just a joke even though it hurt the person. Honestly good idea just, nothing like this can ever be good when people of this world touch it..",6

"('7',)","Review Text 1202: It does pretty much precisely what is advertised, providing free access to listening support, a positive community, and a very nice personal growth path core.

"('1',)","Review Text 1210: This is great for those times when you need to talk with someone, but you don't have anyone at the moment. The notifications are not intrusive as other apps out there, because the notifications are about helping you get better as opposed to getting you to use the app. I recommend it for someone who may be looking for a professional, but who may not have found one yet.",1

The listeners are kind, helpful and professional.   7 cups also has self help guides for further support mindfulness exercises, and tests to help you understand your problems better. Self help guides give you online support to manage the situation/problem and even tell you when you should refer to a therapist.   Had a lovely experience on 7 cups.",2
"('3',)","Review Text 1361: I am relatively new to 7 Cups, and I joined as a listener. I love having this opportunity to connect with people, and to do what I think of as volunteer work wherever I am, on my own schedule. The app is fast, and usually stable. (It has crashed once or twice, but not enough to be a problem, and it's easy to get to the web site in a pinch.)",3
"('5',)","Review Text 1363: A great community but chatting on a phone is a pain because of all those ""helpful tips"" that pop up after every. single. message. It's really annoying to have to scroll up and down and I wish the chatting was a lot smoother like on other messaging apps where you don't have to scroll past a bunch of ""helpful tips"". Overall a really useful chat though!",5

"('3',)","Review Text 1369: This app is fabulous, being a listener has changed my life. It helped me to reflect myself and deal with my problems by following my own advice. I've met lovely people too and it's only a safe app since it doesn't ask for any personal information.",3
"('3',)",Review Text 1370: It's great the listeners are real people that care. All the groups are nice as well. And the symbol is just a cup so people don't know what it is if they see your phone. Has really helped me at times!,3
"('6',)",Review Text 1371: Concept for this is amazing but the app needs a whole lot of work. It's buggy but it does the job. I've joined this a long time ago and I've picked it up again. It's a good place to be in. The people here are amazing.,6
"('7',)","Review Text 1373: Great!  Just what I need right now.  Personal and professional help that I can afford and get wherever I am.....  which is usually home on the couch and comfortable.  Sleepy and depressed wanting to change things and make the great like they used to be but having no idea where to start in this jumbled, unorganized, depression fueled existence that has cost me my happiness, desire to do things, even bathe, and leaves me with no quality of life.  No real money to pay for help either..... as well as no ride.  This is so great.  Thank you a million times for making this a thing.  Time to pull myself back up and fight again.  It's so nice to feel excited about something again.....  especially when it's the future!!",7

"('7',)",Review Text 1387: Great tool for those in need of support through a trained listener. The app could be better to make everything accessible-- I've found that it's difficult to access self-help guides and other features that are readily and easily available on the web/full version.,7

I can't tell you the rewards you feel inside to helping others...Love this app,3

About 25 minutes after installing it, I decided to try it out and I got someone anonymously chat with about what I was feeling and going through in that moment. Our chat didn't solve my problems but it felt really good to have a listening ear and to be in a judgement free space.",3
"('7',)",Review Text 1402: Great place for advice and support but my biggest gripe is that you cannot delete chats. They just sit there forever and the x button does nothing.,7

Thanks to 7 cups, I finally feel like there's a real future a positive life out there just waiting on me. The app is a little confusing at first but well worth the efforts changed for the better and I finally fit in. I am part of a great community now. I don't feel so lonely, overwhelmed​ or out of control when my anxiety hits. I find that sticking with the paths, talking to others and following app suggestions are just what I've always needed. Psychiatrists and psychologists, if they are any good will tell you that you need a community of support.",0
"('2',)",Review Text 1420: A nice community to guide you to the help you need. More than self-help. Connect with real people who have been through similar struggles,2

"('3',)",Review Text 1454: Personally I prefer the site better if I'm looking for something the app doesn't provide. Usually though I'm on my listener account so I prefer using the app during the times that I'm listening because the site takes longer to send messages than the app does. I don't have much complaint about the app... I only just wish they would add more features so I don't have to keep going back and forth every 2 minutes! If something good would be done with that I would gladly give 5 stars! ☺❤,3

"('8',)","Review Text 1467: I cannot say thank you enough for this app. Had I not found it today, I dont know just where I would be.  My wifes ex-boyfriend kidnapped her children (my stepchildren) and I have not been myself at all since. This individual cooked up a plot to get out of paying child support and used his own children to make it so. He falsely accuses my wife and I of hurting those precious babies because we learned that he has been molesting children for who knows how long now. The police wont help us because my wife and I are gay and also because he is a very AMAZING liar and everyone just believes everything he says. This has triggered something in me that if I had not found this app today - i truly believe I would not be here right now, my shock from this traumatic experience has all but crippled me. I dont eat. I cannot sleep. I have become very afraid (had NO fear before), silent (i used to LOVE engaging conversations with others, i never met a stranger), seek isolation,  and become highly panicked at the slightest disturbance.

"('5',)",Review Text 1951: People on 7 cups really encourage you to try. Even if you are depressed and you just want to disappear than they actively listen to why that is. Even if they don't really get you and your life they still help you to the best of your abilities.,5

"('7',)","Review Text 1957: Sometimes it gets stuck on certain things which can br annoying but it's been good so far. Although,  I do think there need to be more respectful lgbtq+ friendly therapists. They need to know the language/verbage being used because when they choose to misgender folks it makes things a little more than hard. It's also extremely hard to navigate the conversation to talk about what's wrong when we have to stop and teach them everything. We live in a digital age everyone has access to it so let's put it to goid use.  The same goes when relationship stress is tackled like any other issue. Relationships aren't always love-centric nor are they always platonic and as therapists they need to be able to address those situations as well.   Also, I love the group chat feature simply because one-on-one doesn't always cut it. Multiple opinions can be extremely helpful for certain situations! All in all, this app has been helpful and I know y'all will work hard to even out the kinks soon so I can give y'all 5 stars.",7

It gives you the choice to stay anonymous for a one-time conversation with an trained active listener, or to register an account which allows you to stay in touch over longer periods of time and all of that for free.

I've never so far seen an app/ site that's quite hardworking in monitoring the kind of people that helps w/out insulting anyone and the people it wants to help with.

"('3',)","Review Text 4912: The 7cups app is a fantastic move from this ever growing organisation to  expand and reach more people in need everywhere. The app is fast,  organised, displays well and you can communicate and browse easily - just  five of the most important functions that any user will undoubtedly demand.  As someone who is both in need and also training seriously as a Listener, I  find 7cups to be such a godsend. You can jump in and out of focused group  chats (Depression, Relationships, LGBT, General etc) as and how you need  depending on your mood and personal requirements. You can find Listeners  and therapists at any time of the day, and are prompted daily to take part  in little tasks and exercises to help you explore, socialise and grow when  you login. As someone who suffers with depression, I frequently find that I  need that push and it very much helps. You can reward each other with  Compassion Hearts on comments and messages, that can earn you rewarding  badges on your profile, and help represent not just what you have been  doing and are most talented at, but the same vice versa. This makes it  easier to communicate with others, and discover their experience, interests  and skills. It is also very comforting to know that someone is particularly  good at something you need them to be skilled at. Trying to navigate the  main website on a mobile phone or tablet isn't always fantastic, no matter  how organised the website is. So this app is the perfect add on for any  Android user. There's lots more to discover and explore, such as events,  discussions and the forums. But why wait? Download the app today and dive  into the fun, and complete your growth path, discovering more about  yourself on the way! Good luck :)",3

"('3',)","Review Text 5107: From a tech point of view the actual app can be really buggy and can't access as much of the site and through a browser. I've seen a lot of comments from users saying about  the service itself that 7 cups offers. Let me say firstly that I only ever connect with listeners in 1-1 chats. I dont participate in chat rooms and have also never tried out the paid therapy so can't comment on those. My first experiences on there were horrendous to put it mildly. I came across listeners who were simply perverted and only wanted pics and to chat elsewhere so they could get away with sexting etc. As a victim of trauma I was looking for support not any kind of relationship. I did get coerced by one listener to speak on another app which ended really really badly to the point where I was going to give up on 7cups altogether  but as a desperate measure I reached out once again. Thankfully I managed to connect with an absolutely brilliant lady this time. She helped me a lot with previous experiences with listeners and also with my original issues with my trauma. She has helped me long term now and her support is still as strong as it was the first day.  It's recommended that you search for a decent listener and while it's possible that you come across some bad ones who have reach quite  a high listener level, by taking time to read through reviews etc on each listeners profile it can help sort the good from the bad.  My listener has literally 1000s upon 1000s of chats and 100s of star ratings and reviews. She is definitely one of the best ones around. Don't be put off by all the bad things you read about this site, just take care when you are selecting a listener. There are some really good people around who give up their free time because they care  and actually want to help",3

Just wanted to provide a quick update...I recently had the opportunity to use the newly implemented feature.

Answer : No. As soon as your body recovers from anxiety you'll wake up naturally, feeling better and better everytime. One thing to remember : every hypnosis is in fact SELF-HYPNOSIS.",0

I had to do a thought journal as part of cognitive behavioural therapy and this app made it super convenient and easy (otherwise I'd probably have given up pretty soon).

"('7',)","Review Text 637: I mainly use the thought diary, which is really well set up, wIth sections for identifying thoughts, challenging thoughts and drop-down menus with lists of failings and cognitive distortions.  I find the editing & navigating the text entry fields can be a little glitchy with my galaxy s3 keyboard.  And there's no way to export diary entries, which makes it really hard to give my therapist my thought records.  I guess I'll try screencapping...Still a great app though.

"('0',)","Review Text 22: hands down the best mental health app I've ever used. fantastic for helping me come down from panic attacks using different grounding techniques. my favorite feature is being able to rate my feelings on a scale, it always slows me down to think about what I'm feeling, how much I'm feeling and where I'm feeling it in my body. you can also journal in the app which is a nice feature (albeit one I rarely use)",0
"('2',)","Review Text 23: This is a great app. It's not only a diary but it helps you track your negative behaviours, as well as your positive ones, and even has self-help technique.

"('8',)","Review Text 26: This app was so much more than I expected. I only expected the forums but what greeted me are all these helpful tools. It even has a diary! The community is nice too. This helped me feel better ever since I used it. Thank you, developers! There is still room for improvements though:  1) profile pictures. it's hard to track who's who and who posted which even though I know that I've read their names before. pictures would help us know and remember each other better.  2) notifications. I wouldn't know if someone replied to me unless I check the posts again, which is kind of frustrating.  3) Direct messages/chat. there are some people who post only a snippet of their problem and say that they are looking for somebody to talk to. i think these are the people who prefer to converse with at least one person instead of venting out everything to lots of people. a chat feature would make them feel less lonely and know that they have a friend. I hope these will help. Again, thank you so much for this app! Keep it up! :D",8
"('7',)",Review Text 28: OK really like it but it needs a couple things doing to it.                                        1.forums- should push notify you if your message has been replied to as it can be very frustrating constantly seeing if someone has replied to your message.                                                    2.forums...again- you should set up a mailing system so people can get direct mails so it can be a personal conversation as well as a group conversation,7

I cant filter out certain categories of questions it gives, and a lot of these questions are food related and food mention upsets me more when I'm anxious so it using this app can help and hinder me.

"('7',)","Review Text 58: It is a really good app! One that I find is helping me a lot! I would even be prepared to pay an initial cost for it. The only negative point however is that it crashes on my phone often. I get half way through my diary entry, it crashes and then I have to start over again. I think an auto save feature should be available, so if it does crash, I dont have to start all over again. Rather frustrating if im having a bad day. I used the app this evening fot about 10 minutes  to have it crash on me 4 times. However that's my only upset.  If that was fixed, would happily give 5 stars!",7
