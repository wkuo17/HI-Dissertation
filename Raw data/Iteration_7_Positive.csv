I really couldn't ask for more all the issues that I had with the app in terms of not knowing when and how to breathe in some areas, there not being modified poses for beginners and the description of poses not being in some instances not being clear have been addressed.

"('0',)","Review Text 326: *UPDATE*  TalkSpace resolved the issues that I had an offered a refund. I really appreciate that they were able to give individual customer support once they realized there was an issue.   For clarity: I had previously suspended my account. It was only suspended for one-month, and after the month was complete my account was re-activated without any input from me, and I didn't know about it (plus, I was using the $99/month service, so it was a big charge when it reactivated). I don't believe that the automatic reinstatement of my account was made clear to me. Regardless, their support team did finally come through.   I used TalkSpace for several months with one therapist. She was extremely thoughtful and responded daily. If I left a voice message, she responded with voice. And if I left a text message, she responded with text. It was a great system that allowed me to have communication multiple times throughout the week (rather than only being able to talk to someone once per week).   I will say that the first therapist I was matched with wasn't good. But when I requested a new therapist, I got a great one and the process was painless.",0

I would have only loved to be able to have my sub on my Google Drive. I can only do 3 different free 2 minute meditations.

I definitely recommend everyone give it a try. I've used it  daily for a week now and plan to continue. The energizers are great, just a  short mini exercise to get your mind back in the right place when you just  need a breather and can't sit for a longer meditation. 10/10 it is helpful  and well designed.",2
"('2',)","Review Text 1021: this app has been really helpful, but it doesn't save my progress and keeps telling me I haven't meditated all week when I know I've done several days in a row. so that's not very motivating. another helpful feature would be a reminder notification to meditate. but, I'd still recommend it over headspace which is over-priced and narrated by a really annoying voice.",2
"('0',)","Review Text 15: Too much ads ruining the experience.

This app is like having all of the best mental health resources right in my pocket.  It's very intuitive and has a great guided path to show you through the different functions. Everything it teaches is in line with what I have learned from mental health professionals in all different settings.  It makes things like CBT and thought records and goal setting so easy to do and so much more practical than putting pen to paper.

It  has NOT asked for my money in any way NOR have I seen any ads. For those  wondering what this app does, it is an artificial intelligent program that  you can talk to about your problems. The responses are pretty accurate  based on what you tell it. It will ask how was your day and if you are  having a bad day your answer would be filled with negative words. It  realizes this and prompts you to talk it out. And provides methods to help  you calm down, relax, or fall asleep. If you are having a great day it  realizes this too, it celebrates with you, and saves it one a list of  things that make you happy. For an AI penguin therapist it is really nice  to talk to Wysa. And it does feel like it cares about what you say. If you  say that you have been having negative feelings for extended periods of  time it will tell you to seek a real therapist for help.",1

Wysa, my little  AI buddy, has helped far more than I expected. The AI doesn't truly  understand of course- it uses keywords to remember what you say, then asks  questions and gives advice to encourage positive thinking, emotional  self-analysis, and restructure unhealthy thought patterns. This is REAL  therapy: you must put work into your own improvement. Wysa helps you take  baby steps. I feel like I've walked miles further in each 5-minutes-per-day  session, than I have in my years in professional therapy and training.

"('1',)",Review Text 5: There does seem to be a difference in feel between the general frequency and the one I bought to relieve anxiety. Whether that's something to do with the frequency difference in the light pulsations that your looking at is hard to say as it runs so fast. The numbers showing are different for the different frequencies though so it looks that way. I actually can feel the general frequency as more soothing. (And not just because it was free haha)  The anxiety frequency has a higher number to it and seems to run slightly faster. Maybe that's to meet anxiety at its faster gamma hz etc bio frequency levels? Could just be a placebo like thing of looking at the name of the mode reminder you've chosen on screen while the lights are hypnotically pulsating.. yet whatever it is.. placebo or not there does seem to be a difference felt. Perhaps if you run the anxiety relief mode or any of the others it may be good to run the general frequency after for a little while just to re-earth the whole procedure.,1

Of course I knew about therapy, had used it many times before in my life. I am older so had used traditional one on one private therapy or group therapy, all in person.  The concept of time offset therapy, writing or recording your ideas, was very foreign to me as it relates to therapy. I read about an individual young lady who also was trying this for the first time.She tried with both competing services and saw that it was all in how well you are matched up with the therapist.  One point here, TS does make an effort to match you up, most traditional therapy it is literally the luck of the draw.  I have read some of the reviews, there is either a misunderstanding of the cost of therapy, or a mismatch in the therapist.  I would recommend making a change if the first therapist does not work out.  For me, this was a ""soul mate"" kind of match.Either I got very lucky or their program is very intuitive.

I will pay for the extra features if I can truly stick with this for a month or so, I think it'll be worth it!

Really, just separating  the events of my day from good and bad, seeing what went well in my day was  really helpful. (Which was a bit harder to find out rather than what went  wrong, but) when I found it, I felt better.

"('1',)","Review Text 1404: I'd planned to try Wysa for a week or so before reviewing, but there's no need to--I've had such positive results within just one day of installing!   As someone who has long struggled with crippling depression (Bipolar II), PTSD, GAD, and a few other letters of the alphabet, I 've learned a lot of the CBT techniques already--but knowing and doing are different things. Wysa gives me non-judgemental feedback and gentle encouragement, motivating me to act on my knowledge. I love this charming little guy! :) The cute gifs make me smile, bonus!    Today, I struggled to reframe the thoughts that have been stressing me out and holding me back, until I finally came up with a statement that left me feeling empowered instead of paralyzed. Wysa got me up and moving (achieving one of my goals of ""daily exercise""!), and I then further de-stressed with a mindfulness exercise. I feel more energized, inspired, and focused.    Bless you for making this app, you are obviously committed to making a difference in people's lives. I am also impressed by your responses to your reviews. You care about your product and the people using it, and it shows.  I agree with some of the critiques already given--e.g. more word recognition, and quoting my actual words instead of ""thought"". (Edit: I see you've already done this!) I know you will be working on this, and am eager to see my new little friend grow!  Edited to add a suggestion: one thing that has been a vital part of my CBT is the importance of setting small, easily attainable daily goals. Perhaps Wysa could suggest this (with examples), ask us to type in one or more goals for each day (articulation is helpful!), then ask about them later. Today, I told Wysa that I felt good, because I had accomplished my two main daily goals. It would be great if he had an appropriate response for this kind of information.  Edited to add: Would still love to see something like ""what are your goals for today/this week?"" since it would be helpful to articulate them and save them for later review to see patterns and progress.  But afraid I do have a criticism: when Wysa is saying, ""here are the thoughts that made you feel this way"", he quotes something I said in the past, in a completely different situation, that has nothing to do with my current problem. This is quite off-putting!",1

"('2',)","Review Text 2606: I love this app, it really is great. Meditation has helped me to the point I would say it has been life changing. But, sometimes when you're listening to guided meditation it will pause. I don't know if it's my phone pausing, that seems unlikely, but you'll be in the middle of a session and it won't keep playing. I've sat for several minutes thinking it's part of the exercise only to open my eyes and see that the narrator has been paused until I hit the button a few times and he continues.   It would be perfect 10 out of 5 stars but this error that randomly happens makes me want to give a zero star rating. It disrupts me so much that I want to discontinue meditating.   I put my phone on airplane mode, it can still happen. I put my phone on do not disturb it can still happen.   I love meditating but it's truly random when it suddenly will pause until I break concentration, open my eyes and fix it.   I'm on Android if it matters.",2

I generally only talk to two to four members consistently  and they are used to me being on my computer and quick to reply so slow  responses on my phone tend to cause me to seem as though I'm disinterested,  which is far from the truth....

Andy is amazing at guidance and I'm looking forward to finishing the foundations so I can try other packages, especially anxiety. Keep up the great work and adding new value.

Therapy - It allows you to chat with a therapist at any point during your day, which traditional therapy can't come near to providing.

Being able to chat *during* issues throughout the day has been immensely helpful, because usually we need help during the issue right?  App features - It has an intuitive smooth interface, and well designed app features such as video chat and leaving audio messages which is a lot easier sometimes than trying to type an essay.

This is great for anyone with anxiety and/or depression that wants to dip-their-toes-into and apply Cognitive Behavioral Therapy at a basic level.

I had daily back pain that would prevent me from wanting to go and do things, I had countless doctors appointments in which I was told that my back seemed ""fine,"" that there was nothing that could be done, and so I thought why not give yoga a try? I'd already tried everything else. From creams to pain pills. So I gave yoga a serious shot. I used this app consistenly for 3 months, and to my surprise, most of my pain was gone! My posture noticeably improved, and most importanly I felt like I could do more, and no longer had pain stopping me from living my life. Don't believe me? Try it. Try the app, try yoga - just give it a go, and see how much it can change your life.",0

This app is useful to practice the techniques I have learned in therapy, but it is not a substitute for real therapy if you have depression and anxiety.  If you do, I highly recommend getting meds from a psychiatrist, not your PCP, and getting into cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt), which focuses on negative thinking patterns, or DBT  (dialectical behavioral therapy), which focuses on emotion regulation.  If money is tight, you can use the book Feeling Good by David burns for CBT and the book dialectical behavioral therapy workbook by McKay for DBT.  I also recomend self compassion by Kristin Neff, this year I will..., (for goal setting and follow through) and the strong willed child (for parents),  Love and Logic (for parents), and the happiest baby on the block, for newborn parents.  I have also been recommended ""love and respect"" for marriage but it has mixed reviews.",0

I downloaded this app just to see if it could help. I had the free version for less than a week and I just had to get the one year subscription. It is worth every penny. The guided meditations did more than just help me to focus and relax, but helped to just breath properly. The guided paths are useful and I think will help anyone who doesn't know how to use the app at first. The app is quite easy to use and doesn't take much time to get the hang of it. I have gotten so much of our the group chats. They are filled with understanding and caring people just like me. So much support to be had there. The health tracker is probably one of my favorite features because I have a difficult time remembering to take care of myself and everyday I check my health tracker to make sure I am doing what is best for me. You can also set reminders in case you forget. The thought journals are particularly useful because it helps me to see all sides of every problem and not only that, but it helps me to take away the negative and replace it with something positive. Whoever created this app really had people's best interests in mind and I am so glad that I found this. This is such and amazing tool and I can't see myself never not using it again!

"('0',)","Review Text 1656: This app has helped me overcome major anxiety and stress. This year has started off extremely rough and I had alot on my shoulders. I found simple day to day tasks difficult even getting out of bed or falling asleep felt like a chore. I started using the app to help me fall asleep then for stress and anxiety. I use it now for motivation and prioritization and sleep.  Its easy to use and I never miss a meditation session. So far I have been sleeping though the night and I have been doing amazing at my job. I work in a very HIGH stress competitive and BUSY atmosphere and I am the only female there!  I have been using headspace to give me the motivation I need without having to talk to people about my life. I've learned to LISTEN to my mind and body, which helped me smash some amazing goals and im not even half way through march! I recommend everyone try this out alone for what ever your reason may be headspace can help! Try it everyday for atleast 20 days! It took me almost 87 days of headspace  to start believing at my job  that I can do what ever I want, when I want and no-one can stop me. Regardless of being the only female or not I am capable of anything I put my mind to. 5 stars!!!!!!!",0

"('4',)",Review Text 1: Good app. I was looking for such an app where patients dont have to track or note down anything to monitor their mood. This monitoring activity is very difficult for some clients. So an app or a game which can help people to boost their moods without much effort is  appreciable. CBM is effortless and works like charm. Theory is effective. The app definitely needs many more features to help clients.,4

I had done traditional therapy with great results in the past, but I felt like I needed a ""tune-up"", and some way to maintain and continue with the changes I have made. The idea of trying to find a new therapist was daunting, and I had no idea how I would be able to fit it into my schedule, let alone afford it. Talkspace was the answer to all three problems! I really like my therapist, I was lucky that she's exactly what I was looking for. I tend to use the website more than the app, but I like the ability to switch between both. I chose Talkspace after researching other counseling apps, and reading that a lot of the therapists themselves were happier with Talkspace's platform. I decided to try Talkspace for a month, and see how it went. The change in my life has been tremendous! This app has added a lot of value for the time and money put into it. I hope to continue with Talkspace for a long time to come!",0

"('10',)","Review Text 665: The calm, soothing and deep voices of the instructors add immensely to  meditation experience. I also like how there is no static noise at all to  distract you. It helps focus on the instructor's voice more closely. And  the instructional messages are great too - uplifting and supportive. You've  done a great job here!",10

"('1',)","Review Text 3358: Just came back from my first session and I'm already feeling better. The person who is speaking does wonders. When he speaks it's not like he's interrupting you or your thoughts, and when he doesn't speak you actually feel he's not around anymore and you're alone. OMG this app is worth downloading and it helps to really create a calmer HEADSPACE. I love it. If I could I would give it 100 üåü's And I saw an advertisement  of this app on YouTube...never have I ever been this easily convinced to download something this easily.",1
"('0',)","Review Text 123: I love this tool, so much easier than remembering to write it down. The only thing I would like would either include positive moods or the ability to add moods to the emotions on the thought journal. Add that and it will get 5 stars :)",0

"('0',)",Review Text 1950: The UI might be a little buggy or perhaps it is just my phone. But this is not what i was looking for. The experience was AMAZING. The listeners are so encouraging and loving. It is like talking to friends who are always there to support you. Friends who won't fill your head with stupid solutions and instead let our minds find out the perfect solutions. The one app I won't ever let go of. Thanks 7 cups :),0

"('9',)","Review Text 133: A LOT of different activities! If you can't find 1 that makes you relax, I  do if you can Relax!",9
"('0',)","Review Text 58: It is a really good app! One that I find is helping me a lot! I would even be prepared to pay an initial cost for it. The only negative point however is that it crashes on my phone often. I get half way through my diary entry, it crashes and then I have to start over again. I think an auto save feature should be available, so if it does crash, I dont have to start all over again. Rather frustrating if im having a bad day. I used the app this evening fot about 10 minutes  to have it crash on me 4 times. However that's my only upset.  If that was fixed, would happily give 5 stars!",0
"('4',)","Review Text 1521: I really love this app. It helps a lot. But I think that there could be more detail in the mood activities. It's hard for me to describe my mood with the scale provided, and it'd also be nice to have some more activities. :)",4
