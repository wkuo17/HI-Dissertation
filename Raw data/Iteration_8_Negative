"('4',)",Review Text 69: Alarms do not work. I've missed at least 50% so far because it never asks  me to fill it in. Can't fill in parts you've missed or even go backwards if  you accidentally click yes instead of no.,4
"('4',)","Review Text 168: As someone diagnosed with depression and mood disorders, this app is  seriously lacking. I'd be in the middle of an panic attack and there wasn't  any questions pertaining to how I felt. Most of these options are too  limited to even make an assessment. Please go see a professional if you  think anything is wrong. Don't trust this. Thier response: Dear Kaylah, I'm  sorry to hear that Moodpath wasn't helpful for you at all. Currently, the  app is focusing on the criteria for a depressive episode (as defined by the  ICD-10 and DSM-5 classification), so there is no detailed screening for  anxiety disorders such as panic disorder. We will include questions on that  in the future.- Your Moodpath Team Thier title literally says ""depression  and anxiety"" and yet they are saying that they dont record anxiety? Then  why is it your title? Depression disorder includes mood- anxiety included.  Thier questions are not consistent which means questions from day 1 part 2  may not apply but do apply for day 1 part 3. But the questions are gone so  if you answer honestly it looks like you don't have depression. Depression  covers mood, behavioral, cognitive, sleep, and much more. Asking a total of  what 10 questions per day at random is not a diagnosis. Or even an attempt  at one. Your depression can lead to ocer eating, not under eating. It can  lead to anger, not sadness. This isnt reliable. Sorry.",4

"('4',)","Review Text 929: Great concept but it doesn't work. The app would only let me answer one, MAYBE two batches of questions per day, continued questioning me beyond 14 days, then abruptly stopped and wouldn't give me the promised summary. I totally wasted 2+ weeks on this, only to be let down in the end.",4
"('4',)","Review Text 969: How is this garbage app rated so highly? If you aren't chained to your device, you get locked out of a set of questions after something like half an hour after the notification, and you can't answer early. I'm in the middle of a pretty severe depressive episode and downloaded this app to help me keep track of what I'm going through, but had to redo the first 14 days probably 4 times. And THEN this stupid app told me I'm fine, presumably because depression causes me to binge eat, not lose my appetite, and I'm not suicidal. Newsflash: depression does not always equal suicidal ideation, and downplaying non-suicidal depression is hugely harmful.  In short, this app is not only unhelpful but also ridiculously frustrating. Not recommended.",4
"('4',)","Review Text 1058: DON'T TRUST THE RESULT OF THIS APP!!! If you think you may be depressed, seek help. I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and downloaded this app to see if it might give some insights to share with my therapist. After the first two week period the app said there was no depression indicated, which I thought was weird. Then the details said I had expressed ""no sleep disturbances"" even though I had answered ""yes"" every time it asked if I had slept badly the night before. I decided to give it another try, and set it to go another two weeks. Same thing. My moods were consistently lower than last time, and my sleep was marked as bad every time it asked. The idea of this app is great, but it is not even remotely well executed.",4
"('4',)",Review Text 1083: It says to go ahead and answer the questions that it has for you. I tried to answer the question and then it says something about dragging the dumbbell weight to where it needs to go over the backpack. But on my phone it just freezes. I am deleting the app because there was a lot of fine print that didn't really make sense and I wasn't sure if I'm going to be charged for services. It sounded like a grid app and I'm sad that it didn't work to try it. There is just no way for me to complete what it asked me to do.,4
"('4',)","Review Text 1084: Very inaccurate.  I am currently being treated by professionals and the results of their assessments (i.e. PHQ-9) are very different.  Perhaps something is wrong with the app because my results were that I'm in normal range, when the majority of the questions I answered I had to select the weights.",4

"('4',)",Review Text 1101: I like the idea of this app and really wanted to use it but it is wayyy to buggy.  Alerts seemed infrequent (but maybe I just didn't notice them?) But when I did click on an alert that new questions were available 9 times out of 10 it wouldn't load the questions and there seemed to be no way to get them to appear.  When I first started the app it kept on reasking me the same first question and acting as if I was just setting up an account.  Last straw is it now keeps on showing an error saying I have no internet access which I assure you I do. Not worth the hassle.,4
"('6',)","Review Text 1109: I've really not found this helpful and I've found the questions don't fit for most moods an thoughts. If you miss a time slot even by a short time that's it you can't add it, which is very frustrating and I don't think I need to be given any more negative feelings. It's a good idea but needs a lot of work before severely depressed people should use it. Deleting",6
"('6',)","Review Text 1181: There is no visible place where I can contact the developer, so here is: on the info page, it says laziness is the cause for depression (under knowledge&gt;body&gt;energy and drive). I assume this is a mistake because when you click on it as an answer, it shows you that metabolism is the reason, not laziness. Edit: there are mistakes like that in other lessons too. It is really bad for people with depression to read they are lazy, not interested in their partner, not worth anything etc. Please review your app and fix it. It might make people feel twice as bad.",6

"('4',)",Review Text 1186: The app has poor grammar throughout and the questions it asks are strange and oddly placed.

Noticed this on two different devices. Honestly, the service doesn't seem  to be worth it. Updating this because this app is still utter garbage. Noni  barely works.

These people have no  idea what they are going on about, spread misinformation about mental  health, have lack of empathy and never reply. When I politely told a  listener that they were being unhelpful after they told me that ""therapy  was useless"" they joked about it and then blocked me.

"('6',)",Review Text 14: I have no idea why they added a disclaimer that you have to agree you are  not suicidal. That's like saying you're a hospital but you don't take  anyone in who is injured. All that does is ostracize even further the  people who need help the most.,6

It kept sending me 'inspirational photos' even after the 'Stop' prompt, and  wouldn't even comprehend the information I did give it about my problem. I  could talk to drying paint and get a response back better than this.",4
"('3',)","Review Text 29: This Email is couple things that I feel need to be addressed. The first one  being that the quality of Listeners has significantly dropped since I  started using your service when it first came out. First as a member then  as a listener. The problem is that when I connect with a listener they  either don't respond after saying hello, or do not have the capacity to  respond in any sort of helpful manner. It's an issue of professionalism.  While I understand that you can't fully control the quality of listeners on  your service, I think that you can do more to screen potential listeners so  that you can provide a better service to those of us that are in need. The  people on the other end of these conversations are actual people with real  problems and if you do not do everything in your power to ensure that they  get the help they need, then what is the point? The other issue I have that  I feel needs to be addressed is the availability of your listeners that  supposedly are available but never pick up a request. I have searched for a  listener to take my request for up to an hour. And even when I do get  someone to respond, I get one word responses that show no amount of  interest or sympathy. If you have listeners that are online and they are  not actively taking requests then I suggest that you give them three  chances to take a personal request before locking them out of their account  for a period of time. This service is a great tool for those of us that  need someone to talk to but have nowhere to go for help. But if the quality  of your service is poor then you're not really helping anyone and I just  don't get the point. Thank you for reading this and I really hope you take  what I I've said seriously because I feel that it will help you with  creating a better service. Thank you.",3

Even if she didn't want to talk to me for whatever reason, still should  have left it up. Would have been nice to have her say why she was not going  to talk to me.

It comfortable giving my card information without knowing what im even paying for.  I'm sorry if this is rude but the $5 a day charge that you essentially need to agree to before you even get your trial seems like it's preying on vulnerable people.

It looks like a child made it 10 years ago. I haven't really interacted with the community yet (my own issues, not related to the app itself) but navigating the app is terrible. The menus don't always open or close. Pressing the back/close button on my phone just makes it jump around from screen to screen, usually the growth path and one of the recent screens I had open, but there's zero logic to it.

He was befriended by a man a so called listener who turned out to be a paedophile and he groomed my son over time. He eventually got him to chat on different site then he blackmailed my son to send him pictures and awful videos. I tracked the man down and he was arrested. STAY AWAY FROM THIS SITE ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A CHILD. IT IS A VERY DANGEROUS THING TO LET A STRANGER INSIDE YOUR HEAD. My son is now seeing a real councillor and he needs it after what this site allowed to happen.,3

The connect with listeners and therapists features either never works (no one is available to talk) or costs more money on top of an expensive subscription that gives you absolutely no benefits.  It's also extremely difficult to cancel as you literally cannot cancel it from the app and have to go to the website, then search for the faq about how to do it instead of there just being a button for it and then go to the google play site and search for your subscription there and then cancel it.

I cannot for the life of me understand how a service for listeners amd therapists exist when most are unavailable during the weekends and holidays. They ask for payment to provide help and talk to a counselor, so why pay for something over a weekend or holiday if you simply can't.

I've been in a devastating situation when I could finally bring myself to open the app, only to find a lot of volunteers who surely are great people and have the best intentions, but they didn't seem to know how to approach someone in a difficult situation, and more important how to initiate a supportive conversation at all.  I felt like I was supposed to know 100% what I should be saying before trying to talk to them, and when I could finally expressed the distress about my situation I was met with very short-lined and nowhere-leading responses. I really appreciate the existence of apps like this, but this one didn't give me a positive experience. Also, even though I recognize that therapists must be paid to be able to offer their services, the therapist option is still unaffordable for many people including myself (the price is not part of my rating) It seems that in today's society, trying to be a mentally stable, functioning person requires cash by all means.",3

A disorder is not a duality; it takes more  than 40 two-option questions (with no context or variance) to even begin to  understand the human mind (and the multifaceted complexities wherein).

Or ""I'm stuck in a negative thought cycle."" It then provides  suggestions like guided meditation or attempting to think better thoughts,  I guess. But it's not good for more complex situations. Like, ""I'm have  trouble with my personal relationships"". This would require a more nuanced  explanation and understanding. It would require a human. For that, you'd  have to pay 16.00 dollars per month. Maybe I'll give that a try because  that's inexpensive, but I'm almost ready to uninstall. Old Review: I think  I'll stick with it to see how this works out, but I honestly don't see what  everyone is talking about.

The scariest part about recent updates is that Wysa is terrible at recognizing signs of self-harm/suicidal ideation.

After day 10 (40 minutes) I've realised that this app isn't for me. Essentially, it's just a reminder to stop, be still and try to clear your mind, which is fine. The issue I have is that it's just sitting listening to a man (with a very dreary voice) tell you to feel yourself breathe and that it's normal for the mind to wander as long as you bring your attention back to your breathing and how your body feels.   I'm not sure if I'm missing the point but do you really need an app for this?

If you know anything about meditation, this app is going to bore you to death. It's repetitive. Kinda misleading. The themed packs of 30 meditations for 30 days are all the same meditation with the guy saying something different in the first minute or so. Not different in the meditation. Just the intro, like the ""hey welcome back"" part. It's painstaking and i really super regret paying for a years subscription.",4

"('4',)","Review Text 3554: It is overall great, a bit expensive, but amazing. Its fatal flaw:  Playing on your loss aversion to make you keep coming back through a daily streak that is kept front and center.  I have nothing against the idea of maintaining a daily streak, it encourages making meditation a habit, but there is a way to be smart about it.  Being hurt when you lose a streak is COMPLETELY irrational, but nevertheless a common response. The developers most know this, it is the reason that daily streaks are so effective at making you come back. We most not forget that this same mechanism keeps people chained to (""behaviorally"") addictive games.  If you are going to use a daily streak to make me keep coming back (which in principle I happily do) then please make sure to implement it properly: Take notes from the likes of Duolingo, which allow you to save up for days when doing Duo. might be impossible, and fix technical problems that do not save the sessions done when the phone was offline, NOTHING is more enraging than knowing you have done your Headspace and lose your streak anyway.  In short: Either fix the daily streak or remove it, so I can get back to loving this app.",4
"('4',)","Review Text 3558: Unfortunately, I cannot keep this Android app because the app cannot be moved to secondary storage.  I'm like every Android user and have limited available space on primary storage.  Because of the OS and other required data that must be stored on primary storage, I have to move apps to my SD card after I install them in order to make room.  I understand that users must first install apps to primary storage on Android.  That's fine.  Users should then be able to move apps like this to Secondary Storage in App Storage Settings.  This app does not allow that.  Sadly, I have to uninstall this app now since I don't have enough space on my primary storage to keep it.    To be clear, developers can enable apps to be moved to SD Cards.  I understand that there are legitimate reasons why some apps can't be moved to secondary storage.  For instance, App Widgets or Alarm Services will no longer work from apps run on Secondary Storage.  I'm not sure if those examples apply to this app, but again, my opinion is to let the user make the trade off.  Some users like myself will give up features just to be able to move the app to SD Storage.  For me, it's better to be able to keep an app with limited functionality than have to uninstall it altogether.    I've heard that some developers prevent their apps from running on SD Cards simply because the app may run slower.  I surely hope that is not the reason with this app.  My opinion is: Let the user decide.  As it stands, I can't use this app at all because I don't have enough space to keep it installed on my primary storage.    The reason that I believe this app deserves a lower star rating is because the developer has the option to allow this app to be moved to SD cards, but the developer has not implemented that.  Furthermore, other competing apps in the Google Play store can be moved to SD Cards.      SUGGESTIONS FOR THE DEVELOPER: If there is not an unsurpassable reason to allow users to move your app to SD Cards, then please change the ""android:InstallLocation"" attribute in your app to allow it to be moved to an SD Card after installation.  If you are worried about a second-rate user experience, then simply display a warning to the user of the functionality that will be lost by running the app from an SD Card.  If you haven’t heard this suggestion from other users, then please keep in mind that many are probably just uninstalling your app when they run out of primary storage space on their phone.  Users with an SD card in their phone usually have tons of available storage there, so there is never a reason to go through those apps and uninstall them.  In other words, another good reason to allow your app to be moved to SD Storage is the users are much less likely to uninstall it to make room for other things on their limited primary storage.    If there are legitimate reasons that your app can't be moved to a device's SD card, then please at least create a setting in the app that allows users to store the App Data on the SD card.  Thank you so much for considering my suggestions and feedback.  I'm passionate about this because I would otherwise like to be able to keep and use your app.  :)",4

It seems to be a larger headspace problem as it occurs for me on my computer, Android phone, and iPad and on multiple networks. (Though it is most likely to occur on my phone). It's meditation, so doing the same one repeatedly is alright, but not worth the steep fees they charge.   I spent 3 months trying fixes I found in forums and installing new updates then contacted customer support. After a month of back and forth they said they were not able to ""to replicate the behaviour you're describing on our end."" After further back and forth they were able to refund my subscription.

Frustrating, the opposite of why I subscribed.    Every tech product will have technical difficulties at some point--that's fine. But most products don't hobble users' ability to troubleshoot problems themselves.  The app's meditations themselves were fine, but you can find similar guided meditations by searching for ""MBSR"" (or ""mindfullness base stress reduction"") on youtube.  **Edit: I reached out to the Headspace support team before writing this review and uninstalling the app, and it did not change my concerns about the Headspace UI.",4

"('6',)","Review Text 765: I'm downgrading my review to one star. This app is advertising in a misleading way. If anyone needs help in determining whether or not spend money on this service, read my review.  This is what the app IS: A place where you can vent. If you don't have journal at home or a journal-like space on your computer and you would prefer if that journal occasionally talked back, this is for you. If you feel like you can't talk to friends/family about something in your life, this is for you. It's an app for lonely people to feel less alone. It's a place to air your thoughts. It's a place where someone will ""listen"" to you and tell you sympathetic things. (Examples: had a breakup, pet died, moved to a new city, fighting with a roommate, don't like your school or teachers, considering a career change)  This is what the app is NOT: a place where you can find comprehensive, in depth therapy for serious/legitimate mental issues and pressing life concerns. If you are really struggling and you need to work with someone because there are problems that are consuming your life. DO NOT BE TEMPTED BY THE FACT THAT YOU CAN ACCESS THIS ""THERAPY"" FROM ANYWHERE INCLUDING HOME; PUSH YOURSELF TO SEE A *PSYCHOLOGIST* OR A *PSYCHIATRIST* IN PERSON! A lot of the responses will be taken straight out of a textbook. If you are having a really hard time this WILL NOT HELP YOU.   (Examples: depression, dealing with the death if a loved one, self-esteem issues, anger issues, bi-polar disorder, suicidal thoughts, phobias, divorce, addiction, etc.)  My experience is that this appears to be a part time job for the therapist/counselor. You're a second thought despite the price. I tend to hate leaving my house so I thought this app was for me. Considering the severity of my symptoms, filling out charts and being sent photocopied suggestions was not what was going to help.   I think we really, truly need to reassess what we consider to be counseling and what we consider to be therapy before applying that label to various services. In addition, clients should get one month free so that they don't have to find out at the end of $140 dollars that this is not going to help them at all.",6

You've got CARTOONY sounds, some of which don't fit (spiky ball) , though you've got a few decent realistic sounds (the small bearings that you can roll around, the keyboard key, and I guess the switch/chalk? ) Sound is a huge deal that deserves more attention than a mute button. Heck, it doesn't feel receptive to my input at all. A finger tapping/dragging for a second should make a shorter sound than a longer, drawn out motion for items like the window and chalk games. Not to mention the physics and sound combining into something monstrous in that 5-ball pendulum, where you hear a rapid series of clicks as momentum is transferred from end to end when there should only be 2 - 1 going out, and 1 returning. And looking at the trailer for the ""quiet pack"" shows that the sound is of similar quality. For crying out loud, it's 40 bucks for a mic and you can probably make most of these sound better by recording physical objects instead of bothering with what I'm assuming are stock sound effects.  I'm mad, but this is an ire of passion. I see this app has some potential but I'd honestly rather use real items because this is nowhere near passable, even if it's free, and real life doesn't sound like a cartoon.",4

They will delete posts that don't insult anybody just because they disagree with them, it may be about politics or something else. The community is full of immature kids who think that having a hard time in your life makes you special and trendy. If i had the option i would give it 0 stars. Avoid this app.",4

Now it rarely gets a reading at all and only if it's resting heart rate... and that's after waiting about 3 minutes (ignore the ""time remaining"" display, it's total bs) standing still! Even if it read higher heart rates, it would take SO long to read, that it would be resting hr by the time it was done. The ""heart rate monitor"" app is MUCH better in terms of consistency and quickness ... sadly,  I do prefer how this app  presented the data 😦",4
"('5',)","Review Text 4379: Seems to detect quite well.  Shame about the full screen pop-up ads which detract from the app. It gets worse, there are even full screen videos which you have to wait to close. Unacceptable if using mobile data. Also the constant nagging to rate it is starting to get annoying. Just reinstalled it and have removed it again straight away. It's even worse now.",5
"('5',)","Review Text 4383: I was using this app for a while and it was fine, but the most recent update has made it so slow, inefficient, and unwieldy, and added constant requests to upgrade, that I am uninstalling it and using something else that will actually be ""instant"" as the name purports this one to be.",5
"('1',)",Review Text 4384: Too many login reminder pages. Goes into infinite loop if you deny permissions. Used to work great on Galaxy S4 when flash wasn't too hot,1

"('4',)","Review Text 4541: I've used this app for a few years and it has worked perfectly. The latest ""upgrade"" does not. My resting heart rate is between 55 and 60 BPM. The app sometimes reads 76 and other times 82 BPM. Totally wrong. How can I get the old one back?",4
"('4',)","Review Text 4542: I like the changes to the interface in the new version, with the ""insights,"" better tagging, and general conformity with the developer's SleepTime app, which I use every night. But this app is now the top drain on my battery, even though it's rarely in use. The problem seems to be that the app keeps the mobile radio constantly active. I'm forced to uninstall until this is fixed.",4
"('4',)",Review Text 4544: I've been using this app for a very long time. It used to be simple and just worked. The latest additions made it horrible. Why do I need to sing up for something?? I guess it's time to uninstall after all these years. Too bad that such a great app was pretty much killed... Too bad!,4
"('5',)",Review Text 4552: This used to be the best heart rate app but now its full of ads and unnecessary permissions,5

"('4',)",Review Text 4556: Actually it's a just an OK app. I am giving 1 star rating because it was forcing me to give 5 star rating every time when I start the app.,4
"('4',)","Review Text 4712: The latest update removes the ability to sync data to Google Fit where it's visible to other Fit-enabled apps, presumably as a way of prompting users to sign up to their own syncing service. App interoperability is important to Android users, this is disappointing. I'll update my rating when out-of-the-box Google Fit support is re-added.",4
"('4',)","Review Text 4714: Keeps starting and running in background.  Seriously, for a heart rate app?  Killing battery life.  Uninstalling.",4
"('5',)","Review Text 4843: More ads, including intrusive and loud video ads, while no noticeable difference in features. Don't upgrade!",5
"('1',)","Review Text 4958: I used to love this app until several updates ago. It worked perfectly but then stopped detecting my pulse. While trying to detect, the numbers jump all over from extreme highs to extreme lows but never leveling out enough to even start the count down timer... The longer it takes, the hotter that light becomes. My longest wait time was just shy of 6 minutes... What happened?",1
"('4',)","Review Text 4975: ""Would give no stars if I could""... You've read that before right? Well, this app just doesn't work. Arguably the problem is the underlying science doesn't work.   I've only seen it take my pulse in a well lit room when my heart rate is 66 or so. And that's only sometimes.  Just suck it up and get a good heart rate monitor.",4
"('5',)","Review Text 4977: I have used this, S Health and the old fashion way (finger on wrist with a watch). I got the same with S Health and finger method but not this one. It was way off. Too many ads on free version, like every time you use it. So sick of advertisements for games that last 15 seconds. Save the space on your and don't download",5
"('4',)","Review Text 4999: In the end, it gives good readings, but by then I've spent several minutes with the timer jumping between ten and three seconds. I'm left with a burnt finger and a drained battery. I've jumped back and forth between this and a similar app to ensure that I'm holding my finger consistently. The other works smoothly and painlessly every time while this one does not. Using a Moto X.",4
"('5',)","Review Text 5009: Full screen ads appear right after taking a reading, requiring a precise tiny x click to dismiss. Ad along bottom is positioned right above interface yielding frequent accidental clicks.",5
"('4',)","Review Text 5019: Why cant I get a HR while I am running? Does anyone else have this trouble? Great for resting heart rate but ever since I have used this app its never worked for when I am working out/moving : bicycling,  running even walking. I have to stop then it takes so long to get a reading my heart rate has lowered which misses the point. Anyone else have these issues? It happens on android and apple phones",4
"('4',)",Review Text 5032: Had my heart rate checked by a nurse 15 and 10 minutes before using app - both times it was 113. The app said I was at 68.,4
"('6',)","Review Text 5046: The product itself is fine. It works good but the adverts are misleading especially the one that informs you that the phone has viruses. I know this a lying advert but some people would be worried about this and then spend money trying to sort it out by buying antivirus software that's not needed. Adverts are fine, out right lies are not cool.",6

"('5',)",Review Text 5221: Full page ads after every reading? Really? Bad enough that one's prompted to sign up for azumio every time. This just makes it more annoying.,5

"('5',)","Review Text 5427: But not when I'm served intrusive video ads, which is exactly what I received after the last update.",5
"('4',)",Review Text 5477: Works good. I liked that it syncs with Google fit. But it only syncs once. Never does it again unless a new version gets installed.,4

"('4',)",Review Text 3: Fantastic app! I love all of its features and the different tones are  amazing. This app has improved my life in so many ways! Edit: after the  most recent update I can no longer use this app that I paid for. It says  too many devices. I have a tablet and second phone. I was not told when I  purchased the VIP package I would be limited to only 1 device. So when my  phone is charging I cannot play it off my tablet?! I want a refund  immediately! 6/11/2017 after updating the app my playlists are gone. I  continue to be disappointed i invested any money into this app. Sadly it  used to be amazing. Not any more.,4

If this gets resolved I'll change my rating.",1
