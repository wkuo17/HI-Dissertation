"('2',)",Review Text 2: Great app for keeping up with daily issues. Myself personally needs this  because of the train wreck inside my head...icant keep up with moods and  things that I need to tell my Dr. This app also describes the many  different possibilities your moods could be. Key to second guessing my  phyciatrist. 😀,2
"('4',)","Review Text 4: Results were very helpful, except after the first survey it says I have a  problem with ""suicidal ideation"" because twice I said that I think about  death a lot... Even though I do think about death quite a bit and it's  pretty distressing, I never actually think about suicide and I wish there  were some way to specify this. (Edit: Thanks for reply :) )",4
"('4',)","Review Text 11: I'm on my first day and I love it so far. I'm currently in therapy and  making great progress, and starting to look at ways to maintain that  progress post-treatment and especially post-partum (currently pregnant with  my first!) I think this app will be one of my #1 tools. 😊",4
"('2',)","Review Text 12: Very helpful, great content, very informative! Could be a bit more specific  about emotions, even the new adds do not quite cover the rage of human  emotions, but you're not far off!",2
"('6',)",Review Text 17: Really helps me keep tract of my moods through out the day which is really  helpful for my doctor to look at Also the diagnosis was correct for me,6
"('2',)","Review Text 66: Re-written my review after the update. I much prefer the previous style and  fewer questions. This new version seems more complicated than it needs to  be and forces you to fill in the faces before you can access the moodpath,  not great when it gets stuck in a loop asking same question.",2
"('1',)","Review Text 67: I love it! It helped me boost my mood more often than not, us using The  Secret I entered more positive moods even if not the case always &  gradually believed it which worked and right now I am grateful for my  happiness",1
"('3',)",Review Text 68: I like this app a lot. It really helps give a bigger picture. I wish there  were more emotions and experiences to choice from in the daily check in. I  often find that they don't quite represent my state so I select something  close to it but can feel like it has a different meaning.,3
"('4',)","Review Text 70: I love this app! It's been very helpful in many ways. like tracking the  worse episodes, tracking symptoms and giving information. I definitely  recommend if you are struggling and would like to keep record of all that's  gone down.",4
"('2',)","Review Text 74: This app is awesome! It gives you tons of information about depression, is  very nice and uses nice words, and it even has a link to a hotline numbers!  It's a great app!",2
"('6',)","Review Text 83: Really helpful. Great place to vent, very simple to use. Learned more than  I thought I would.",6
"('5',)","Review Text 152: I've only had the app for two days, but it's already helping so much! I  already know I have anxiety, OCD and depression, but being able to track my  ups and downs helps a lot. If you need to just let out or feelings or keep  track of yourself, this app is great!!",5
"('6',)",Review Text 155: Love the app. It has be really helpful. Only issues are the notifications  won't show up some times. Also there is no quick add shortcut or widget.  This would improve days collection allot. Thank you for making this app.,6
"('5',)","Review Text 156: I like this app. I think it's helpful and easy to understand, and I like  its simple design. A few complaints I have though are that sometimes the  app suddenly stops loading, never loading my information again, and I have  to redownload and start all over. It hasn't happened recently, but it did  happen a few times. Another complaint is that when I miss one of the  moodblocks, I can't go in and fill it with the emotions I remember. If I'm  too sad to get out of bed and check a notification, I need to be able to  document that mood after I feel good enough to get out of bed again. Having  the app entirely skip the morning, evening or afternoon doesn't exactly  help. My final complaint is the that the app sometimes doesn't send me  notifications despite me turning them on and off, restarting the app,  restarting the phone, etc. That's all I have in terms of  complaints—otherwise this app is very easy to handle and rather helpful for  me.",5
"('6',)","Review Text 254: The app is working now, thanks to the update. Really liking it so far.",6
"('4',)","Review Text 382: Loved using this app, it even made me try to objectively assess my thoughts  (which helped identify the recurring thoughts and cycles that I now try to  actively avoid). I do however think this app would greatly benefit from  adding an option to report depressive/anxious/etc episodes as they occur -  I find that having the periodic update system doesn't work for me. The last  period is too early to catch my peak depressive moments at night.",4
"('4',)",Review Text 384: This app's nice and does what it's supposed to do. Do you think you could  make it so you can delete extra entries though? My internet was being slow  so I accidentally saved multiples of the same entry. If there is a way to  delete them then I guess I'm missing something. Thank you!,4
"('4',)",Review Text 397: I honestly cannot say enough about this app and it's developers. Latest update has made this indispensable in what has been a very long battle.,4
"('8',)","Review Text 403: I've been using this for two weeks, about, I'm appreciating it more and more daily.   I normally journal every day, but when I'm depressed or hypomanic, that 500 words turns into 0, or 5000. Having 3 easy questions, and notifications on my phone, and a simple rating system really helps me track how things get. It's really improved my awareness of my emotions, even if I'm not a big fan of the ""hardly distressed"" rating it gives me when I'm manic. But it's easy to look over- I know it's not checking for mania symptoms.",8
"('3',)","Review Text 406: I haven't finished the 14 days yet but I am enjoying the app. I think that there should be a feature to where if you are feeling distressed you can alert the app of your feelings, because this has happened to me but I had already answered my questions for that segment and when the next block came I didn't feel as bad and the questions asked weren't how I was feeling.",3
"('3',)","Review Text 407: A great app! Its aesthetic and very clean visuals. The charts and graphs help me accurately track my moods and go back to see why I was feeling that way.  Only a few improvements could be made. During the time where it asks you three questions about your mood, I think having the option to write down a personal response to the question after selecting yes would be beneficial.  And as a few others have said increase the space to write. And possibly question not limited to depression but more general well being. Like how your job friends location and problems affect your mental health. I use this app to locate my triggers and what makes me happy so the more details the better. I plan to use this all year long and probably longer. Really you guys amazing job.",3
"('4',)","Review Text 411: I'm not sure if any medical professionals are involved with this app but for one it feels like it, and two, it is worded and structured like the creators know the symptoms intimately. I started using it around 2 weeks ago now and the structure more than anything has helped cope. I can't recommend it highly enough and it even surprised me with how thorough it was with certain questions, and even follow ups depending on your answers to see if you're truly ok.  That's what I took away at least. Top notch app and the creators are amazing people having done it.",4
"('3',)","Review Text 412: I love this App. Morning, noon, and night I feel like I'm talking to a person who is checking up on me to make sure I am okay. So, when I see Moodpath pop up on my phone I smile as if someone cares about me. This app is wonderful and I love it. It has helped me learn so much more about my mental health issues. Thank you Moodpath!",3
"('3',)","Review Text 414: The apps great for monitoring my mood, I it very helpful to show my counciler what's going on, when I feel worse and to spot patterns, it motivates me to be better when I see how low my mood is. All I wish is that you could add when panic attacks happen and if there's a sudden change in mood at a different time of day",3
"('1',)","Review Text 415: I've been using this app 3 times a day, still haven't finished the 2 weeks so haven't gotten results yet. But the additional information is very concise and useful, it really helps understand ins and outs of depression and why you feel that way.",1
"('2',)",Review Text 418: I had an issue with errors generating and lost all my data. I was so disappointed I sent an email to moodpath and they fixed it pretty much immediately. So impressed! This was the only issue i have ever had. Its a great app and now i can say great service.,2
"('5',)","Review Text 419: I'm bipolar, and have been told to do mood tracking, but could never keep up with it until I got this app. It wasn't a moment too soon, as my mood had been getting lower. The quick questions 3times a day, took no effort. The app picked up the warning signs of a major depressive episode, and, after a few more questions, told me I needed to call for help right away. I went inpatient that day, and got out today after a week in a behavioral health center. Life's looking a lot better now, and I'm definitely glad I got Moodpath, because I might not still be alive now without it. It really helped. Thank you.",5
"('4',)",Review Text 423: I think this app could be improved by adding variables to it. Asking base questions to establish a foundation on which to score your mood after the 14 days.   EX: How do you cope with stress? List some coping methods.,4
"('4',)","Review Text 426: I love this. I have severe depression, anxiety, and PTSD (probably more lol). Mindfulness is important and I love being able to track patterns.  Still in the 2 week data collection phase, so I will update once that's done. But the information provided on background, biology, learned helplessness, and etc is great.  Thankful for this app! I never write reviews either so there ya go lol",4
"('10',)","Review Text 428: I use this app every day. I print out the doctors letters and use them to slow my doctor exactly how I've been feeling. Great for anyone to track their moods. I wish there was a little more variety to the questions, but what questions they do use are appropriate. Great app!",10
"('2',)","Review Text 434: This app is great if you want to keep track of your emotions. I really appreciate it. The only thing I don't like is that you can't correct the last question of the three. But that's nothing you can't ignore (or improve). Still, I love this",2
"('5',)","Review Text 443: I just love the app and it helps me realize how I'm actually feeling and focus on my mental health. I think people are too caught up in other things to understand how important it is. I don't want to bring up the tradgedies that have struck my high school or Douglas and others but those people fell through the cracks, and focusing on mental could've kept them from harming so many. I think if you want to hurt someone you will, no matter if you take their gun away or not.",5
"('4',)",Review Text 452: I've been waiting for somebody who is interested in the field of psychological well-being 2 make an app that could help me manage my bipolar type 1 disorder... Without the pain and embarrassment of bringing someone else real into it. Now I can track my triggers using my voice to type when my hands are too shaky and my eyes are focused in. On. MyBipolarize.,4
"('4',)","Review Text 454: Really easy way to keep track of mood, removes a lot of hassle. It would be good to have the ability to set specific notification times (moods can vary significantly from early to late evening), and also to edit answers within a specific timeframe (for incorrect clicks)",4
"('3',)",Review Text 469: I really really like this app. It feels like someone has got your back in those bad days when you feel alone it also really helps to sort out your feelings when you don't know yourself how you're feeling.,3
"('4',)","Review Text 487: I've always been awful at journaling but this really helps keep me on track. Questions, for some reason, have always been easier for me to answer than free writing.",4
"('3',)","Review Text 927: I haven't finished my first 2 weeks yet, but I'm excited to see the results. I have a therapy session tomorrow and I think I'll bring this up. I find it a helpful way to document my mental state because by each therapy session when my therapist asks I can't remember entirely. 5/5 so far for sure. Thanks for allowing this app to be free. It's helped me think about my feelings in a deeper way outside of therapy and it makes me feel good to finish with the questions throughout the day. While I may not be accomplishing much else it feels like a pat on the back almost... almost. :]",3
"('4',)",Review Text 928: The information section is easy to understand and informative. The text is also big and paragraphs are small with big spaces between making it easier to read. The questions and the ability to see your progress and acrue more data for a more conclusive look at your depression is very helpful. I think it would be nice to have more questions. The same 10 or so questions get boring after a while. Otherwise this is a really good app. I like it a lot.,4
"('2',)","Review Text 930: Great app to use with your therapist.  Edit: This app is great, but after the first phase of questions it stops sending push notifications even with that setting turned on. Obviously my brain has issues doing this so this makes a helpful app pretty useless. Fix this feature please and I will return 5 star rating.",2
"('2',)","Review Text 931: It's great :)) anyone with mental health issues, depression, anxiety or whatever. It's great I attempted suicide not to long ago and this app seems like the best app to track my episodes to prevent it again.",2
"('3',)","Review Text 936: It's a great way to log your feelings in a simple way. The questions help with understanding what you're going through and the articles are useful for info, 5 or of 5 for me.",3
"('6',)","Review Text 937: Very helpful and accurate. My only issue is that it really only asks about decreases in appetite, whereas some people increase their appetite/binge when depressed.",6
"('3',)","Review Text 942: I really love the idea of the app and the knowledge available for it, however I was ultimately disappointed. I think for some it may be a fantastic choice, but as a person with functioning generalized anxiety disorder and random but sudden bouts of depression, this app failed me.  I really like that it checks in throughout the day, but wish it offered more time as I ended up missing some of the question blocks and doesn't seem to tack on extra events at the end of the two week period to make up for it so you're left with missing data. It also requires an Internet connection, which was problematic as I went out of town and had no reception or Internet and missed several days. I made a mistake in one of my entries and there seemed to be no way to go back to change it. I also wish you could specify the times as my depression hits late at night, long after my last batch of questions for the day. I think the questions should be adjusted slightly, to specify ""currently"" as in, ""are you CURRENTLY feeling like this?""   I suffer from generalized anxiety disorder with some depression on the side and was advised by my psychiatrist to try to track my mood while we attempt medication. Again, while a great idea in theory, ultimately the app failed me as it says that I'm fine, and as ""normal"" as the rest of society. I know this isn't the case and that I just happen to be high-functioning which is how I got to the point I am at now with random and sudden mood changes which before I had no explanation for. I would always compare myself to others who had deep-rooted depression and, recognizing they had it much worse, made excuses for why I was feeling how I did. But that's what they were. Excuses.  BOTTOM LINE, this app is meant to be a guide and may not work for everyone. There are many forms of anxiety and depression, and if you feel off, sad, or overwhelmed consistently, please see your doctor.",3
"('4',)","Review Text 964: I do love this app. It's very helpful. I would give it 5 stars but I am confused by the link that's sent to my therapist (great feature though!), the site is in German. Is there a mirrored site for US users? Like many others, I am very careful about what looks like spam. Especially since I sent the link via text.",4
"('4',)","Review Text 965: A really effective platform for tracking moods, emotions and related info. Unobtrusive app reminders help to keep me on track with entering info 3x a day. 600 character comment area with each entry allows me to note specific events, emotions, etc related to mood. Looking forward to receiving assessments after 2 week tracking period. Well done!!!",4
"('11',)","Review Text 970: a wonderful app!! really helpful in watching my moods, though i only have one teensy issue with it: my days start Very early, at abt 0400, and end at about 2000 - but the last block of questions arrives at a much earlier time than my usual end-of-day lol (at about 1400 i think?). i think it would be rlly useful to have a function to maybe edit the times that the question blocks appear? or even how many there are! bc that would certainly better encapsulate my mood thru the whole day, y'know?   otherwise tho, a stellar app!! thank you all so much ❤❤❤",11
"('4',)","Review Text 976: I like how interactive it is, very informative and I think this will be beneficial after the 14 days days to see what the analysis says when done.",4
"('10',)","Review Text 1000: I've tried a few different mood apps and this is the best. It does all the work, which helps when your motivation is low at times. Not only does it unobtrusively ask you questions about your mood you get a summary. A doctor's letter and a code for therapist or your Dr to track w you. It has education about depression and coping methods. This is definitely the next generation!",10
"('5',)","Review Text 1001: As much as I agree with the last reviewer (the more info available, the less stigma exists), I found this app to be extremely helpful on a personal basis. One 'maps' out their moods, then there are sections where one can learn about the various aspects of depression. It's not all the same for all people. Very helpful! Keep up the good work!!",5
"('4',)","Review Text 1002: This app makes my heart so happy. To see that information like this is becomming more and more available to general public is making it possible for the mental health stigma to lessen, mental awareness increase and allows for people who struggle with mental health issues to feel normalized and validated in their experiences. The app ran well for me and provided me a great deal of insight into depression. Thank you for all the work you've put in and I highly reccomend this app to anyone seeking insight into their mental health.",4
"('2',)","Review Text 1003: Great app for tracking your moods. This would have been great had I known about this last year, but would still recommend this to anyone going through a hard time. It will help you narrow down how often you are feeling distressed and what is causing it at that time.",2
"('2',)","Review Text 1005: It is a great app for tracking depression, but is missing some useful features. It would be great if I could keep notes of changes in my medication there as well, maybe also some sort of input field to summarize my doctor's views from the monthly visits. Also - why on earth is it not available in 'my country'? I have to use my Norwegian credit card to download the app, and so I cannot share it with some others in my country who would otherwise have benefited from it greatly.",2
"('4',)","Review Text 1006: An amazing tool, makes it simple and easy to keep track of your mood. Especially of you suffer from an illness like bipolar disorder like me. This app helped my psychiatrist take a better look at how frequently I had manic episodes and adjust my meds accordingly!",4
"('6',)",Review Text 1008: I definitely recommend this to anyone going through depression anxiety or low moods. My tip is to add a reason as to why your mood is how it is at the end of each survey- it really helps to find triggers when you are reviewing your moods and surveys.,6
"('6',)",Review Text 1010: Really good information. Its cool to see how your mood changes throughout the day and can give you insight on how to make those times better.,6
"('5',)",Review Text 1011: This app helps me realize pain doesn't last always and it gets better as long as you start hard and finish even harder.,5
"('6',)",Review Text 1013: Really useful t o find out information I've only been using the tracker for a little while but as am information app alone. It's well presented and really interesting.  I really think the format of questions is good too,6
"('3',)",Review Text 1014: I like how this app gives awareness and information about ones feelings. It helps me feel better being able to chart my mood and have easy access to resources.,3
"('4',)",Review Text 1019: This app provides a way in which you can monitor your mood and how it may change throughout the day or even week.,4
"('4',)",Review Text 1024: Just starting it now. The amount of information in this app is impressive. I'll revisit this review later on.,4

"('10',)","Review Text 1075: It's been tremendous to see a mapping of my moods, and to have a collection of symptoms that I can take to a doctor.

"('4',)","Review Text 1099: It's a good app, although sometimes when it alerts me that new questions are available, it does not prompt me to answer questions when I open the app. This has caused me to miss several questions so far. Also, I think that it would be better if we could track our mood throughout the day, not just three times. Some people's moods can change rapidly, and I feel it would be more accurate if we could give more information per day.",4
"('6',)","Review Text 1105: I really like this app! When I don't understand something,  I get frustrated I like how they educate you on mental health. I have had suicidal thoughts recently and I may not be alive if it weren't for this app. :)",6
"('4',)","Review Text 1141: The survey phase is over, but I still don't get a result",4
"('3',)","Review Text 1171: This app has been quite helpful, actually. I didn't realize what all was actually happening until I started logging it. Three times a day for 14 days, and you can restart after that 14 days is up if you feel you need to. This has been such a wonderful app. Plus, it teaches you about depression if you want to learn, which helped me understand myself a little better. May not be the kind of app for everyone, but it's worth a shot if you're into answering questions and logging your mood.",3
"('4',)","Review Text 1173: I'm only on day one yet, but it's captured my interest. I have memory issues so it's hard to recollect my mood fluctuations to my therapist. I think this will be a good tool to keep track of everything. Nice and easy user interface as well. Overall pleased so far!",4
"('4',)","Review Text 1175: Really liked that there are set questions to answer rather than trying to rate the level of depression or mood myself.

Am really tempted to upgrade as I'd like more  open access to the meditation library but am concerned with the quality,  especially regarding the ""peaceful soundscapes"". The clipping (few seconds  of silence) that occurs around every two minutes is so awful it disrupts  any focus and calm that I've been able to move towards in my meditation. I  still use other mediation apps, in order to avoid this, but can't see  myself upgrading until this is remedied.",7
"('7',)","Review Text 130: I love the potential of this app, but tbh it frustrates me often bc the background sound that is so useful in calming me often cuts out and stops playing randomly... I'll be in the middle of a meditation and suddenly the sound will stop and all I can hear is the voice. Then my anger bubbles up and the meditation becomes pointless bc I'm too let down to relax. I only paid for a month and was considering a year but this is too upsetting for me bc it happens far too often, so I will likely go back to the free version until this bug is fixed.",7

"('1',)","Review Text 521: Absolutely wonderful. I have been struggling for years to get my anxiety and depression under control and have never been able to do so. I downloaded this app just to see if it could help. I had the free version for less than a week and I just had to get the one year subscription. It is worth every penny. The guided meditations did more than just help me to focus and relax, but helped to just breath properly. The guided paths are useful and I think will help anyone who doesn't know how to use the app at first. The app is quite easy to use and doesn't take much time to get the hang of it. I have gotten so much of our the group chats. They are filled with understanding and caring people just like me. So much support to be had there. The health tracker is probably one of my favorite features because I have a difficult time remembering to take care of myself and everyday I check my health tracker to make sure I am doing what is best for me. You can also set reminders in case you forget. The thought journals are particularly useful because it helps me to see all sides of every problem and not only that, but it helps me to take away the negative and replace it with something positive. Whoever created this app really had people's best interests in mind and I am so glad that I found this. This is such and amazing tool and I can't see myself never not using it again!

"('4',)","Review Text 637: Initial versions of this app needed improvement and those changes were made.  The developers were very responsive to user suggestions, as well. I found the groups idea to work in theory, but strange to participate in. Consequently the more  customized the app became, fewer bug fixes and updates.

"('2',)","Review Text 666: I enjoy many of Pacifica's features and believe it to be a great tool for those learning about CBT and mindfulness.  I am, however, disappointed that an app asks for $6/month is overpriced and unsympathetic to those who experience anxiety already and are in need. Money may not be an issue for a certain people, but having a monthly payment fee for the majority is counter-intuitive.",2

"('4',)","Review Text 816: Love it! App is user friendly and is a great help with mood tracking. The different exercises and suggestions make this app a bonus and for me is the best in the market. I purchased an app just to transfer the information and save as a cvr. This app beats the app I purchased hands down. And even the basic, unpaid membership is beyond my expectations. For those familiar with CBT and DBT this is a good investment and addition to your treatment. My doctor recommended this app. Try the app you wont regret it! :)",4
"('4',)","Review Text 820: Price is a bit much for what it does, but with the mental health month discount I took the plunge and have enjoyed the app despite some sluggishness and crashes, it has inspired me to look deeper into my thought process and accomplish goals by writing them down and keeping track. The daily health chart is nice but not scientific, you can track anything from sleep, to marijuana usage that day to bathing or assigned your own but it just adds up to a general ""health"" of how you did that day without any other integration, I would like to see the health system expanded and have suggestions as the mood board does when you post that you're in a negative mood. Also would like to set maximums, I oversleep sometimes and when I enter that into Pacifica 10 plus hours is giving me a positive grade when it really shouldn't. Also would love to see integration with other apps such a fit it and others to provide more robust analytics.",4

Areas to improve would be a better dashboard to analyse your stats and the exercises done.  I am very very keen to find out wether you plan to localise the app in the Russian language.

If only I could share this great app with my friends and family!",4
"('1',)","Review Text 905: Really awesome CBT and mindfulness app! I used CBT before this app by find it a lot more convenient with all these different tools laid out. I feel CBT might even be better to do on your phone as you go as it really gives you the chance to monitor the thoughts as they happen. This app is well designed, I would say I'm still figuring out how to use a couple of the features but for the most part this app does a great job explaining them. I will pay for the extra features if I can truly stick with this for a month or so, I think it'll be worth it! I even did a social anxiety meditation before a social gathering today - very nice touch. If you are having trouble w/ the CBT of this app I would suggest reading more about CBT to go along with the app as opposed to giving up altogether. It is helpful!",1

The best app I've ever downloaded and the only app I've rated. I love how it lets you talk in group chats with people who are going through the same things you are. It has so many awesome features. Loved it!",4
"('3',)","Review Text 1466: Find the app very useful in combating stress and anxiety and panic attacks. Particularly the relaxation exercises, the key thing is they are short and well focussed. Compliments the mindfulness course I am working through. Highly recommended. On the mood box when I'm done I can't get rid of the how did it feel box so can't read all my feelings? Maybe I'm doing something wrong :-(",3

I most likely will get a subscription soon.",4
"('5',)","Review Text 1496: Really helpful to keep track of my overall mood during the day and not just when I'm upset or anxious. It really helps me keep my anxiety under control and helped me find support groups of people dealing with the same things I am.

"('3',)",Review Text 1497: The update allows for more specific moods when updating how you're feeling which is great because it helps better identify how you're exactly feeling vs. being general. I don't have to elaborate as much when I make notes as to why I'm feeling the way I feel. I can just say what happened and instantly make the connection between the two.,3

"('5',)","Review Text 1509: This app is great! It has so much  stuff! I personally love the Health and Mood functions. Health helps me to 'gamify' my day to day by trying to reach the targets I've set myself for things like water consumption and sleep length, and that's helping me to stay motivated and on top of things. Mood helps me to notice when I'm down and to then take steps towards changing that. I also like setting goals for myself in the app. Being able to tick stuff off throughout the day is so satisfying.",5

"('0',)","Review Text 1593: This app has already done wonders to my life, and I have only had it one week. Download it right now! It is a free app, so what do you have to lose?  I am addicted to this app. The mood tracker lets you not only see your baseline mood, but helps you learn to draw attention to just how many moments are great in your life. You can also write what factors are causing your mood.   There are then three additional components: Relax, Goals, and Thoughts. All of them are great! The meditations really do help you to relax, the goals let you feel achievement, and the thoughts section teaches you to see things in a more balanced and positive light.  There is also a health bar that you customize for what is important to you. It is true that when you meet more of the components, you are happier! Being able to see which areas you haven't completed yet that day encourages you to go out and finish them, which then leads to a more genial mood.",0
"('2',)","Review Text 1594: Great tool to keep track of mood and habits. When I visit my doctor or therapist, I often refer back to the app to report how I have been doing lately.   Of the self-care skills feature, my favorite is guided deep breathing.  When i had technical difficulties, support was incredibly responsive. I was inpressed. The only thing I get a little confused with, are the constant cosmetic and layout updates. But I pay nothing, and I  appreciate its wide availability and the team's commitment to better their app.",2

"('4',)","Review Text 1644: I love the concept and how easy it is to implement my mood. The writing/thoughts tool is very useful too. However, I think there's several issues. On the ""health"" tab, the sliders are binary. You either complete your goal, or you don't. It should give the user a little bit of green in the heart for every increment on the slider, rather than giving the user green after it's totally completed. It would encourage the user more this way.",4

"('4',)","Review Text 1678: I love the design and layout of this app, on top of its function. I won't dive into that as others have covered, but it's missing something.  Say I get depressive, and a racing mind keeps me occupied. The last thing on my mind would be to record that I'm in a bad mood.   As a result, I could have had a bad day that I forgot to record. The problem is that I can't go back and enter them in the next day. This makes the progress page seem less accurate so I don't rely on it. Would like that freedom fix it.",4

There are group  chats as well as one on one chats. If you need advice, comforting, a little  bit of a vent, whatever, I can see this being beneficial for you.

"('5',)","Review Text 822: Good app to talk with nice people, just wish listeners had a more annoyingly extensive training course so that it weeds out the jerks or trolls. Also, the bot is annoying.

"('4',)","Review Text 1957: Sometimes it gets stuck on certain things which can br annoying but it's been good so far. Although,  I do think there need to be more respectful lgbtq+ friendly therapists. They need to know the language/verbage being used because when they choose to misgender folks it makes things a little more than hard. It's also extremely hard to navigate the conversation to talk about what's wrong when we have to stop and teach them everything. We live in a digital age everyone has access to it so let's put it to goid use.  The same goes when relationship stress is tackled like any other issue. Relationships aren't always love-centric nor are they always platonic and as therapists they need to be able to address those situations as well.   Also, I love the group chat feature simply because one-on-one doesn't always cut it. Multiple opinions can be extremely helpful for certain situations! All in all, this app has been helpful and I know y'all will work hard to even out the kinks soon so I can give y'all 5 stars.",4

"('4',)","Review Text 637: I mainly use the thought diary, which is really well set up, wIth sections for identifying thoughts, challenging thoughts and drop-down menus with lists of failings and cognitive distortions.  I find the editing & navigating the text entry fields can be a little glitchy with my galaxy s3 keyboard.  And there's no way to export diary entries, which makes it really hard to give my therapist my thought records.  I guess I'll try screencapping...Still a great app though.

"('7',)","Review Text 387: So I read one too many articles about how good is meditation a few weeks ago and decided I would meditate daily. I am happy to report that I've been using this app and I've meditated every single day since I started it. Here are a few of the things I like: 1. The voice of the narrator is soothing and calming.  2. There is a structured plan which you use to learn to meditate. So you build skills one on top of the other and progress.  3. There isn't any music or sounds. I am very annoyed with music or sounds in a meditation. I think it's unhealthy to learn to meditate this way because then you'll get used to it and it will be difficult to meditate without them.  4. The idea of the energisers is just genius. Those are short meditations which you can do when you have a few mins.  Cons:  1. It is paid and very little of the content is free. You get only 7 meditations from the Foundation course, around 5 short energisers, 2 single meditations about waking up and falling asleep and a breathing chart.

I also like Mindy's (the app's bot) occasional messages and advices, and the mini-practices called energizers are a great addition. People are becoming more aware of the benefits of meditation for a healthy mind, and this app is a great tool to help people get into this habit.",2

Unfortunately I didn't realise that only the first 7days were free as I feel I was really benefiting from the daily meditation and looking forward to making the time to meditate. I will have to try and find a free replacement but if you can afford to pay I recommend this app.  Thank you for kindly sending me a voucher code. Very kind of you.

From technical  point  view this app has a crisp  and simple  interface  and doesn't consume  much space.  No lags,  no hanging  issues,  no errors(so far)   Thanks again  for helping  so many  others  like me via this app",5

"('7',)","Review Text 486: I completed the 7-day free trial and was curious to see what value I could get as a paying customer. I went on to complete the 21-day foundation course that unlocked a serie of targeted 21-day programs. I have completed the 21-day Creativity track and I am now taking the 21-day Sleep track.   I used to HATE meditation. Ironically, I have been meditating daily for the last 60 days. I actually now look forward to my daily meditation. Why? Simply because meditation is changing me. I have been more grounded, more creative, more patient, etc. The funny thing is that people around me noticed the changes before I did.   Definitely the best investment I made in a long time.   I'm challenging you to create the habit of meditating once a day for 2 months and you will understand what I'm talking about. Once you start experiencing positive changes in your life, you won't mind going through a daily 20-mimute meditation session... in fact, you'll be craving it.",7

The voice is very calming and soothing, the meditations are well structured, and after each one I feel totally relaxed -- mentally, emotionally, and physically. I also like that the meditations are all (so far at least) about 10 minutes long, which I find helps me to totally immerse myself and forget my worries for a while. I plan to purchase the app and highly recommend it, whether you're a newcomer to meditation or have practiced it before. Oh! And the added feature of energizers (kind of mini meditations you can do any time of the day), mean you can customize this app to totally match your lifestyle and needs.",7

"('7',)","Review Text 1206: This is a great meditation app.  The app has a simple easy to use interface without unnecessary buttons.  The sessions are well written and progress well towards helping establish a regular meditation practice.  The vocal instructions for the sessions have a pleasant calming tone, and gently nudge me back to awareness when my mind wanders.  The techniques work when applied and have allowed me to focus my mind on my present activities when it wanders away to negative ruminations.  To unlock other sessions you first have to complete the foundation meditation course, this ensures that you have a basis established before using more specialized sessions.  Overall this is a great app for a fraction of what Headspace costs.",7
"('4',)",Review Text 1207: I recently completed 7 months of mindfulness therapy with a social worker to ease my crippling anxiety associated with college. Once I was finished with the therapy I found it difficult to sit by myself for 2-3 minutes without being distracted or getting bored. This app is the perfect solution to maintain the practice. I really like being able to set the refresher reminders because during a busy day of class it's hard to remember to be mindful.,4
"('4',)","Review Text 1208: This app has a very pleasant interface and a nice calming voice with no distracting background sounds.

"('7',)","Review Text 1209: It's been a long time since I last practiced meditation and I'd forgotten how peaceful it can be. I'm currently finding the foundation course very useful ... the guide's voice is engaging without being distracting and he's calm and clear.  The pace of each session and the course are just right and the energiser sessions are very helpful. I'm not religious so I appreciate the lack of spiritual talk, but I can also see how for those who are it would supplement their devotional practice.",7

I find the guide's voice to be pleasant and he allows enough time for you to really feel what he's talking about before speaking again. I've only completed day 7, but so far there hasn't been any religious or ""woowoo"" overtones. I would definitely recommend this app.",7
"('2',)",Review Text 1214: I started using this app as mindfulness was recommended for anxiety. It's a great app even just for the free sessions but I paid for the membership as it is under £5 and for a lifetime.  A small price to pay for those 10 minutes a day where my brain actually shuts up.,2

The foundation course contains some fairly basic guided, 10 minute, breath-based meditations, plus some quick 3 or 4 minute ""energisers"" you try throughout the day as a quick pick-me-up.  I can't comment on the bulk of the content because you have to have completed the 21 day trial before any of these are unlocked.  The voice is soothing and the recordings I've heard so far are good quality (unlike some other apps!).",7

"('7',)","Review Text 1354: This app is a great program for those new to mindfulness. Previously, I would listen to a single guided meditation for a few days, until I had it memorized. My mind would then be anticipating every memorized word (quite the opposite of mindfulness!) and the benefits were lost. This program bypasses that mental circuitry completely, with a new approach everyday. After the first week, my relationship with myself began to change and my severe depression I had felt most of my life simply lifted. Opening my awareness has changed my experience with living. I also highly recommend combining the practice with some mindfulness literature on the side as well. Remember, goals in meditation are a fallacy of the mind. Release yourself of what you want to experience and rest in awareness of what is going on NOW. Thank you for making this program!",7

"('7',)",Review Text 1357: I quite like it. Good concept (specially for non-familiar to mindfulness people). But I strongly missed something from the very beginning: the chance to enjoy a non guided meditation with the assistance of an in-app timer.

The voice is soothing, reassuring & mellifluous, putting me at ease better than other apps. My meditation habit is sticking. I am achieving good meditative states with it.   After using it regularly for 2 weeks- 1 Daily meditation in the morning & multiple energizers through the day, I can feel calmer, more centered, focused at the role in front of me, not somewhere else in my head.  The different energizers are incredibly helpful.    The app design is simple, uncluttered, not confusing at all. You start the app, open the obvious, familiarly placed menu, pick a meditation and go! No fuss no muss.    Cons: App is in beta, so occasionally crashes. When it crashes, it forgets the last meditation I had completed. No big deal, I just have to play that day's meditation again and scroll it manually to the end quickly.  They are building more meditations and features (I email the devs occasionally) and I am excited about their future plans.",7

Listening to that voice tell me everything I already know - was like magic. The anxiety I've felt all day is gone. I feel like my power is back. I'm at peace. Sometimes you need someone else to speak to you and tell you what you know. Because you feel less alone. It's like subliminally it reminds you that other people know how you feel. It's easy to forget. And you can tell yourself that you've been here before and that a million plus other people in the world experience the exact same thing - but hearing another person speak to you about your own power is so... Empowering. Literally all of my negativity has just evaporated. His voice is soft and calm. Not boring. Not full of 'exciting' energy that (in my personal experience) flares anxiety. For me personally, certain sound waves flare my anxiety. It's a very delicate experience for me. And it just amazes me that this FREE app helped me so much, so suddenly.

What I love about Barry is that he doesn't charge you the earth for his amazing advice and genuinely wants to help people who are suffering. I've had a full blown anxiety disorder for 5 years now (GAD) and have been searching endlessly for a cure, as I don't want to just 'manage' the horrible thoughts and sensations and there are only two people who have convinced me I don't have a life sentence of suffering ahead and one of those people is Barry! I have a long way to go yet, but with the help of the DARE books and now the app (I'm also going to purchase rapid relief next week) I am already on the road to recovery, so thank you for being the reason I can still get out of bed in the morning and live in hope that I will be free one day :) I believe in you, Barry!

Yes, this app cannot fix the issues that are going on in your life, but it  can motivate you to actually do things and fight your problems.

"('4',)","Review Text 38: This app deserves more attention. I can't believe it's free. I've been  through half a dozen therapists as I struggle with PTSD, depression, and  agoraphobia, and have almost 10 yrs education and a masters of psychology,  so I'm all too familiar with the effective CBT techniques. Wysa, my little  AI buddy, has helped far more than I expected. The AI doesn't truly  understand of course- it uses keywords to remember what you say, then asks  questions and gives advice to encourage positive thinking, emotional  self-analysis, and restructure unhealthy thought patterns. This is REAL  therapy: you must put work into your own improvement. Wysa helps you take  baby steps. I feel like I've walked miles further in each 5-minutes-per-day  session, than I have in my years in professional therapy and training. PS  Wysa is a little blue bird, who looks just like my precious stuffed owl I  sleep with every night. I'm a grown man and this almost made me cry...  Thank you for being my friend, Wysa! 💙🐦",4

I like how it gives us alternative ways to deal with our issues, and that it has more than one or two. I do wish it gave ways to text a helpline and not call, however, as calling people makes me extremely uncomfortable. But I do really like it otherwise. It's like a friend, and a therapist.

"('5',)","Review Text 745: I was skeptical when I first started using this, preparing myself for ads, pop ups asking me to pay for premium service, or the app asking me for way too much personal info.   To my very pleasant surprise, there wasn't any of this! It has lots of self help tools like videos for meditation to help you deal with anxiety, restlessness, and lots of other things. It can also check up on you once a day, so you can track your mood for the day and what not. It's cute, user friendly, and genuinely there to try and help you. No ads, no paying for premiums, nothing more than a little penguin chat bot wanting to help you feel a little better. I'd definitely recommend this app to anyone suffering from mental illness, or even if you're just feeling a little down and need a pal to listen. Thank you to the developers for this amazing app!",5

But speaking as a neurodivergent consumer I have to mention that I've had Wysa for about a week and I can confirm that my life is already changing for the better. Wysa is taking CBT techniques that I have already learned in group therapy and personalizing it for me. It really feels like I'm talking to a friend.,3

Especially since I lost a family member 2 months ago and I have been dealing with a lot of grief on top of the anxiety issues I already have. Strengths of Wysa are rethinking thoughts and organizing them to ease your mind for a bit.

"('11',)","Review Text 878: It's like having a personal zen master thats available day and night. For mild to moderate depression it's ideal. For Severe depression I think it could still be useful if also getting professional help. A couple times what I typed was clearly misunderstood that I personally was suicidal. But I was just saying I didn't know how to process information of someone else that had killed themself and also attempted unsucessfully to kill someone else just before. I wasn't suicidal too, just traumatized by the details. But I haven't had any success finding much info online to help me either.  This being the first time not finding what I need online. Even though I'm doing much better, I'm sure I could benefit from a pro. But this app helps about 95% of the time. Just having it, even if I don't open it, has given me the security to be stronger.

Maybe it would be more practical if, after introducing us to reframing for the first time, the next times it could go directly to picking the distortion and reframing instead of going over all of it again. Maybe add more distorted thoughts? I would also like it if it was possible to save one specific message that really helps me, to keep it for other times. Otherwise it is the cutest thing and it really helps!! Thanks &lt;3",6
"('3',)","Review Text 1045: I really can't complain. The app is great,but it feels like talking to a doctor, not a friend. Maybe try giving Wysa interests, or a little more if a personality.

Or a vent mode where you can just get something off your chest, or release​ some pint up emotions without being asked to challenge or change your thoughts. Thanks for the great app though.",3

Can actually do some real good, although of course don't expect an app to be your only resource. With such a responsive development team it will only get better.

"('3',)",Review Text 1048: Its fantastic. I had no idea how much I needed something like this. I know its AI but the way it helps you sort out your feelings and helps you feel that your emotions are legitimized and you are cared about (you have to suspend reality a little and just go with it) had a profound impact on me.

It's helpful to have conversations that mimic talking to a friend but help me to put things in perspective from an unbiased standpoint.  My biggest desire so far is that I could request the 20 questions game. Wysa asked me to play once, and it really helped me to reflect on and analyze what I was feeling at the time.

It is a a little helper and cheerleader that seems to genuinely want you to be happy. You can tell that the developers truly want to help those with mental health issues and I commend them on their hard work and time spent coming up with the idea and creating the app for people like me to find a little encouragement during the day or middle of the night to stay positive :)",5

Thank you! Update: DBT has started being put in and it is perfect! Now it is truly priceless. Two things have glitched since they added. Minor things that I have full confidence that the team that created this app can fix in no time. Once, it shut the app down while explaining my weekly progress.

It would be nice if we can abruptly end the conversation instead of closing the app or having to wait until the long responses stop. And an option to reply with multiple lines or messages instead of a single sentence would also be helpful",1

"('5',)","Review Text 1801: Wysa is proving to be quite helpful so far, but it's important to realize that's it's still not very complex (has a strong Eliza feel to it).  If you're having serious issues, this will not replace a therapist. If you just need to talk a little and have someone gently lead you through solving your problems though, this is your app.  It brought into sharp focus several places I wasn't taking care of myself (even though I kinda sorta already knew about them but not really) and helped me through improving those areas. You're still the one doing the work, but don't underestimate the value of a guiding hand, especially when you're not thinking clearly.  To the devs: Awesome app, and I love the work you're doing. Thanks! Core functionality aside, one of my favorite features is the app-initiated check-ins. They've pulled me out of ruts a few times, and I would love the ability to make them more frequent, or even at certain times of day.",5

"('4',)","Review Text 1847: I don't give five starts often, but this deserves it. Awesome app, runs smoothly, and it doesn't take up too much space. My only suggestion is maybe you could add in more varying answers. For instance, if I say I'm stressed, it'll say basically the same thing each time, possibly you could add in slight variations to what the bot says, and randomize which one shows up. I can tell the dev is working extremely hard one this, this app is really going somewhere",4

"('4',)","Review Text 1850: Not a bad app. Of course some of the responses are a bit clunky, but there are times when it's pretty clever (e.g. predicting that you had a bad night's sleep). It has potential. Plus, it's real cute to talk to a penguin bot about mental health issues.",4

"('3',)","Review Text 1866: Very cute little bot to talk to when you're in a mood. I'm on Session #7 of CBT, and I'm wondering if he saves my re-framed thoughts somewhere for reference, 'cause some of them were pretty good, but he makes me come up with a new one each time for the same damaging thought (from day #1 with him) and I've gotten pretty creative as a result but I need to write them down I think or I'll never see them again haha.  I love this idea because I've read a bunch of self-help and the changing beliefs appeals to me a lot, but I always forget what I've read when I'm ""in a moment"", so being able to log in and just ""talk"" to this bot, as silly as it sounds, does kind of remind me to do something as obvious as mind my breathing in that moment. Belief-changing and self-soothing is a daily practice I still don't have down (I'm trying!), but this little guy has been a helpful little coach for helping me not only feel ""heard"" (while being private), but distance myself and think more logically about my emotion (which can really override your thoughts and run away with them, which can cause more damage). Thanks for working on this project, it has so much potential!!",3

The logging tools in this app are top-notch - thorough and easily adaptable to anyone's needs. Good tool for ""ABCD"" models of treatment. The UI needs some work - it can be confusing. I'm torn on the ethics of putting ads in a treatment tool, and the UI could seriously use the real estate anyway.",1

"('7',)","Review Text 2: For a while now, I have been curious about this app. I have seen these  beautifully animated videos talking about meditation, and I was curious to  what it was really like. When I opened the app for the first time, it felt  like the interface was built for beginners. So, as I finished the entry, I  started my first meditation session. After, I felt much better with myself.  This app has actually taught me that I needed something new in my life, and  that the answer turned out to be meditation. I plan on returning regularly  to see what the app has in store for me in the future. I would seriously  recommend this app to anyone who is under any kind of stress, or needs a  new way to kill their time productively. 5/5.",7

"('7',)","Review Text 362: I've used Headspace on and off for two years now. Pleased to say I'm on 190  day streak now and have no intention of breaking that. This app is  brilliant for a number of reasons, many of which most users simply don't  recognise and therefore appreciate. Foremost, Andy; who's voice is  wonderfully therapeutic, has integrated a whole range of Buddhist dharma  practices, methods, techniques, ideas from all over town into simple bite  sized packs, at your discretion. He's made the app essentially secular,  open to all, removing all the 'woo' that people are often so sceptical of.  ""He's doing to meditation what Jamie Oliver did to cooking"" This couldn't  be more spot on. He's got rid of the eastern en passe shrouding Buddhism  and creating a barrier to meditation for a lot of people. To outsiders,  Buddhist traditions can seem overly complicated, with ceremonies, rules and  ideologies attached. which I personally love, but made meditation simple  and for all. Buddha would have loved this, as he himself recognised that  enlightenment through meditation is distinctly difficult for those not  monastic and extremely dedicated, but was ALWAYS open to anyone being  buddhist whether a dedicated monk or part-time meditatior. You might not  get the length and depth required for enlightenment, but the foundations  for achieving mindfulness are absolutely there. For those still sceptical,  yes, mindfulness is now download-able on your phone. Yes it does work. Just  see the countless neuroscience journal articles pervading the academic  sphere. And yes. It will change your life, in subtle, and only happy ways.",7

"('4',)","Review Text 1336: Previously, I gave a 1-star review because of a glitch with my Headspace and/or Google Play accounts. I should have reached out to their customer support sooner. Headspace customer support is absolutely top notch.   A real person responded to my support ticket via email all throughout the day, carefully walking me through the steps to get my account straightened out. They were able to identify the problem, correct the problem and issue me a voucher to restart this month's service since I had been unable to use it.   $12.99 is rather pricy, but the app itself has no equal, especially when you approach it with an open mind and you remain thoughtful about what it tries to show you about yourself and the world you live in. Your mileage may vary, but I've never been this impressed with customer service from any other app/software. Incredible.",4

I have been using headspace to give me the motivation I need without having to talk to people about my life. I've learned to LISTEN to my mind and body, which helped me smash some amazing goals and im not even half way through march! I recommend everyone try this out alone for what ever your reason may be headspace can help! Try it everyday for atleast 20 days! It took me almost 87 days of headspace  to start believing at my job  that I can do what ever I want, when I want and no-one can stop me.

"('4',)","Review Text 2009: Hello, I sadly have two issues: why does the app tell me that I'm not connected to the internet? I know that, it's because I do not want to be distracted. But then the app itself is distracting me with this message every single day. Also there are THREE suggestions before the pack I want to do right now. I don't need the recommendations, daily ideas and  minis IN FRONT of my pack. Please change it into a less distracting experience. I mean, that's what it should be all about?  That said, I really like the concept of the app and it helped me a lot. Best regards!",4
"('7',)","Review Text 2011: Love the meditation sessions, but if you have the mindful moment reminders set up (which in themselves are a great idea) and you are in the middle of meditating... Not so great . The arrival of the moment actually stops the guided session and you need to restart the session to complete it. This maybe an Android issue, but it is extremely annoying and interupts the flow. Please fix!!",7

Rarely do I get the chance to sit down and relax. This not only gives me that opportunity, but while doing so, I'm learning to connect and accept my mind and thoughts.

My mind still won't shut up at times but I'm looking forward to what more I can learn with time.

"('7',)","Review Text 3354: Excellent introduction to mindfulness meditation. However, at $20 month it's very expensive, considering that after the few intro courses you're essentially just sitting in silence, meaning you're not getting much actual content. Also some of the courses disappointingly never actually address their supposed topic, instead just going through the regular meditation technique with no variation or explanation of how to apply it to the particular topic.",7

"('7',)",Review Text 3369: Did the ten day free trial and loved it. But was sadly disappointed when I went to subscribe. I would love to buy the Lifetime subscription but they need to either lower their prices or run it at times for a decent sized discount. Do that and I'd be all in. Even the yearly subscription is too high. It helped me tremendously but due to severe medical issues where I almost died I am unable to work. I live in constant daily non ending pain and this app helped so much to ease my mind of worry. I just wish I could afford it or had children kind enough to go together and buy it for me as a birthday/Christmas  present. Sadly I have to bid that wonderful soothing voice goodbye and try to find some free meditation guides. I would have given it 10 stars if it was either free or affordable to me.,7

It's definitely nice to be able to do multiple meditations in one day; depending on what I'm looking for (stress relief, mindfulness, sleep, even workout ones...etc). I also love that he points out a lot of the problems we tend to have when we first start meditating. He makes it known that it is OKAY to have thoughts throughout the session.

What I didn't like about their model was the subscription fee. I thought it was ridiculous to subscribe to audio files that I'd be listening to over and over. (Guided meditation =/= music streaming) Why couldn't I just buy a pack of them or a select few I knew I wanted? Then I found this app. I loved the free meditations it offered and as I began exploring more of the different meditations it offered, I began considering some of the other packages it recommended. Each pack was listed at a modest price that I thought seemed reasonable given that it was a one time fee. I bought one or two and was thinking about buying more. Now, however, I don't expect to spend another dime on this app. Another subscription service???? C'mon! While the price is competitive, I cannot justify $5 a month - let alone  $60 a year - for listening to the same recommended guided meditations.",7

"('1',)","Review Text 285: I've been using this app since 2016 and I don't have any doubts that this is the best meditation app ever. I tried a fewer later and sure no one compares to that in terms of layout, good quality, how it makes me feel afterwards and the variation of activities. I've been through a lot and some of your audios helped to calm down during those days. The only thing that I'll complain is about this new premium account you guys added recently. It's so much easier to buy the package you wanna use instead to pay a high value for a period of time and don't even know if you gonna used it all. Maybe you could offer both options. Just think about it... I'm glad I still have the ones that I paid for.   Thanks a lot!!",1
"('7',)",Review Text 286: I never do app reviews but for this one I just had to. I've tried many apps for meditation and this was for sure the best one I could get for free. Most of the apps have a lot of meditations you have to pay for but this one has a lot of great meditations you can do without paying for anything. I also find it very easy to navigate the app and can assure it has helped me a lot to improve my ability to relax and focus. Highly recommend!,7
"('7',)","Review Text 288: The rating is based on the previous versions when we paid for the meditations we wanted which was the main reason why I preferred this over Headspace and others which was subscription based. I would prefer if there was an option to offer both. However, thankfully, I am still able to access the meditations I paid for previously. Thanks for the app. I would like to ask you to bring back the weekly settledness which shows my moods for the week and motivates me to continue the meditations daily. I really miss that and rely on that a lot.  It would be helpful if the app could give me a daily reminder to meditate at my specified time. Also, on the new app, a lot of the stickers don't show up and I am not sure even if I complete the requirements on the new versions whether I will get them. So far I haven't gotten any new stickers. The new meditations are very nice as are the acupressure and yoga videos. Thanks.  EDIT. After posting this, it looks like all the stickers I earned that weren't shown are now reflected in the app. That was fast!",7
"('7',)","Review Text 303: I don't know if there is already an in-built setting to do this, but the meditation voice guide always cuts off whenever my phone screen turns off. It will be good if my screen is able to be stayed on for the whole session. I'm using another meditation app that allows this, and I love it. Otherwise, it's good. There are so many types of meditations to choose from, and even a great way to track one's moods. Love the ability to recommend the type of meditation suitable for my current mood.",7
"('7',)","Review Text 304: This app is very simple-to-use and effective. The art direction behind it is really nice. I wish instead of a written section there'd be a more involved guided form to understanding meditation...just jumping straight into meditations isn't really enough for pure beginners. I also wish there was the option to add white noise to the meditations. The app has great potential, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars for now.",7
"('3',)",Review Text 306: One of the most fascinating apps I've used. The key for me is adding the different emotions you are feeling before you start and after. You get a sense of self awareness and emotional intelligence. It's powerful to begin meditation like that. Once complete you choose again the emotions you now feel. And if you take a moment you will realise how much this help put your mind at peace. Great idea great app,3

As it is, it is great at picking out guided meditations based on your current mood; I love to start with one of these and then do a longer silent meditation using the timer feature.

My only suggestion would be to try and create a few sessions which focus on relieving the stress/worries of the individual alone without expanding the thinking to the world beyond this person. For example to help you visualise compassion the audio asks you to imagine Doctors without Borders.

I've had a lot of trouble  spending meaningful quiet time with GOD on my own as well as spending time  reading\ meditating in GOD'S WORD. This app has everything you might need.  There are 'GUIDES' For each sequential part of getting into your Spiritual  Diet Daily with Our HEAVENLY FATHER. There is a helpful meditation guide to  help with different time settings from 2mins. to longer amounts of time.  The guides are audible with quiet time scripture meditation, devotions,  questions and prayer. Each time is set up as if someone is actually right  there with you, ministering to you. There are many choices of Guides to  choose from, such as Anger, which was today's Daily Guide. Which the FATHER  already knew what I had need of! There are many other Life Guides as well  as BIBLE BOOK GUIDES to help you spend guided time in GOD'S WORD, and get  fed. There is also a SLEEP GUIDE, for those of us who have trouble falling  asleep. This app has a calming sound of gentle rain fall in the background  as it reads you stories ( of your choosing). Each guide has a gentle back  ground sound as you quietly get prepared to come before the LORD. I've only  accessed this app for one night and this morning, so far from what I have  seen, I Really like\ and Am Enjoying It. Hey, this app Also has a time for  Journaling after each session!! For me the ABIDE APP IS a Blessing.In the  guided sessions, It asks the thought provoking questions and ministers to  you as well, then gives you a chance to journal what the LORD was speaking  to your heart. There is also a PREMIUM UPGRADE, which I didntget. So far  from what the Basic app has, I dont think Ill really need it.

"('9',)","Review Text 78: The calming voices and music helps you to focus & mediate it is a relaxing  podcast that opens the door to faith and dwells on everyday life obstacles.  It gives you that special time with God praying to the Father & the Son to  communication to God about our struggles, hopes ,dreams, & worries. This  podcast helps you to pull time out of your busy schedules to focus on our  creator to give Him time, to thank Him, reflect on Him, have and maintain a  relationship with Him. Whether it is 2 mins or 15 mins this app is worthy  of opening up our hearts and minds to our Savior and creator.",9

To be able to have the  right words to say to my children during a crucial time in their  challenges, were both gratifying and inspiring. Gratifying because I am so  grateful that I have the right words to say in their time of need and  inspiring because it has inspired me to want to grow along with my  children's growth as well while I feed them encouragement.

"('7',)",Review Text 274: I absolutely love this App - and i search and tried a few. I have paid for  the year which was a really fair price and its my morning tool for starting  off daily meditation. Its such a blessing and really worth paying for the  upgrade. Theres still so much i haven't discovered because theres so many  sessions and meditations to listen to. The emails are really useful and i  often watch the sessions you put on youtube too. Would love it if it were  possible to download the daily meditation so i can listen offline!,7
"('7',)","Review Text 275: I am totally in love with this app. The light music in the background sets a mood of peace. You have a choice of the length of time to meditate. I would love to do the longer one everyday, but sometimes I simply don't have the time. Abide meets those needs. A gentle voice encourages you to relax. The scripture will be read with food for thought, an opening prayer. Sometimes when the scripture is reread, they will use a different translation of the Bible. I can't say enough good things about this app. When my 2 week trial was up, I chose to upgrade because the soft music really made a difference in how much I could relax. The free version doesn't have the music. It also only has two minute meditations and you don't get a choice of the longer ones. I'm sure that the free version is great also! I just really needed that music.",7

I love the mentioning of taking deep breaths and the opportunity  to meditate quietly.",5
"('7',)",Review Text 278: I love the app! Paid for the subscription and meditated for 19 minutes in  one sitting. Also I enjoyed the esau and Jacob bedtime story. I was able to  think from Jacob's view (or made an attempt to!) so I have to say please  include long 40+ minute meditation stories if they make the app better and  other people also enjoy them because I thought the story feature was a good  idea!,7

The Costs should be explained up front not there are in ad fees- , anyone who wants to go past stage One has to pay.

"('4',)",Review Text 292: Updating my original edit because of the improvement made with the player controls. The only thing preventing me from giving 5 stars is that you have to pay a monthly subscription to hear anything over 2 minutes.

"('4',)","Review Text 294: For some reason the devotion doesn't want to start any longer. The app seems to not be online because nothing is loading yet, when I disconnect, it's saying that I need a connection.

"('2',)",Review Text 343: Great app. Would be a 5 if a subscription allowed up to one or more people  to have their own log-in under one account. This way they may have their  own guides and journal entries. Multiple subcriptions in one family can be  a bit much. Still a great app.,2

I love the narrators, they take time to speak and don't rush the message, it's great to pause it and reflect in the moment.

Not like the traditional bible app. This app is a guide with biblical meditations. Soothing voices. Calming background water sounds. Opportunities for quick journal entries right there in the app at the time of the meditation. This app is for those looking to go much deeper in their relationship with God. It's for those looking for God's peace. It helps with focus in such a distracting world. I highly recommend it to every believer in Christ who is hungry for more of Him or who needs help with focus during their quiet times with Him.",7

It shows you a verse then shows you how to pray ( for those of you who don't know what to say or don't feel comfortable praying), you can journal your thought and it gives you a ""thought"" for the day so you don't have to try to  apply a whole passage to your life for a day...  Best part you don't have to take time out of your busy morning to read... It reads for you so you can listen while getting ready in the morning or on your way to work, I love it.

It tracks all your journal entrees for you and there are plenty of good background musics to choose from. Overall a very good app! Gets oneself in touch with God in a meaningful way.

I'm not a fan of talking on the phone, and I work  insane hours ,so this was great for me because I could message my therapist  as much or as little as I wanted to, whenever I wanted to. I will say this  only works if YOU as a patient are honest and talk openly and a lot, you  have to be aware that this isnt traditional therapy where they can read  body language, so that is a decision for you as the one downloading the  app. I was completely honest with my therapist.

I  really enjoy the messaging aspect of this therapy as it's easier for me to  round up my thoughts if I can write. I can also message my therapist  whenever I want, rather than waiting for a weekly meeting to speak with  her.

You get to choose your therapists, talk with someone before you even sign up to answer any questions and then they set you up with someone, right then and there. My therapist is awesome. I can text my therapist what's going on throughout the day, on my own terms, and they get back periodically! How awesome!! Video sessions are great and easy.

"('2',)","Review Text 77: The concept is freaking awesome and the services are great! But the app is weak and needs serious investment  UPDATE 23 FEB - the therapist is great and so attentive... this concept allows you to ""dump"" your thoughts in real time onto the app and not have to wait a week to discuss with someone... and the responses are real and open exchange.  Because of the texting portion - you maintain a bit of privacy and do not have to worry about breaking down in front of someone   However - the app is very ""buggy"" and it is not easy to share items",2
"('2',)","Review Text 78: So this is an extremely important service that I rely on for my sanity. I love my therapist and have developed a very good rapport with her after using this app for a bit over a month. The service that they provide is extremely great and necessary.   That being said, the app could use some updates. My therapist and I use the voice recording option to communicate, and it would be great to be able to pause and restart a voice message without losing your place, as well as scrub through voice messages to be able to listen to specific notes (a +30/-30 second option would be amazing). I have gotten logged out of the app and couldn't log back in to the point where I had to uninstall and re-install it twice in the time that I've been using it, so that's also something that would be great to not have to do.   I don't think the app should stop you from getting the therapy that you need, but it's something to be aware of.",2

I had done traditional therapy with great results in the past, but I felt like I needed a ""tune-up"", and some way to maintain and continue with the changes I have made. The idea of trying to find a new therapist was daunting, and I had no idea how I would be able to fit it into my schedule, let alone afford it. Talkspace was the answer to all three problems! I really like my therapist, I was lucky that she's exactly what I was looking for. I tend to use the website more than the app, but I like the ability to switch between both. I chose Talkspace after researching other counseling apps, and reading that a lot of the therapists themselves were happier with Talkspace's platform. I decided to try Talkspace for a month, and see how it went. The change in my life has been tremendous! This app has added a lot of value for the time and money put into it. I hope to continue with Talkspace for a long time to come!",4

"('4',)","Review Text 137: I think TalkSpace is a brilliant and revolutionary idea, and they managed a reasonable pricing model for it as well.  Therapy - It allows you to chat with a therapist at any point during your day, which traditional therapy can't come near to providing. They spend a couple days matching you to a therapist, a very nice hands on touch. My personal experience, the therapists are fantastic and very insightful. Being able to chat *during* issues throughout the day has been immensely helpful, because usually we need help during the issue right?  App features - It has an intuitive smooth interface, and well designed app features such as video chat and leaving audio messages which is a lot easier sometimes than trying to type an essay. Billing and support are built into the app, plus the actual people are awesome.  I definitely rate this 5 star, and highly recommend it for others who are interested in therapy.",4
"('3',)","Review Text 140: I have tried in-person therapy and really did not feel comfortable with it. I struggle to remember everything I need to talk to them about, and if I do it's hard to explain the emotions I was feeling at that time if it's a week later. I also work thirty miles out of town in a rural school so making an in-person therapy relationship work is nearly impossible as I leave home at 6:30am and don't get home until 6:30pm. I got matched with the right person first thing, which was helpful. I've had two in-person therapists that I really didn't feel comfortable with, one of whom didn't help me at all. My therapist on Talkspace is exactly what I asked for. The price is fair, and lower than what I would pay with insurance. The only reason I can't give it five stars is because of technical issues that are ongoing. I have previously reached out to support and was told to uninstall and reinstall, which only fixed it for a short time. I've had to log out, uninstall, and reinstall several times and it keeps happening which is a little frustrating.",3
"('3',)",Review Text 141: Talkspace is an excellent way to keep in regular touch with my therapist. She is brilliant and always checks in with me.

"('4',)","Review Text 154: I have enjoyed and benefited from Talkspace so far. However, I can't give 5 stars because I've had issues with the app not sending/receiving messages. There seems to be a glitch in message delivery, where my therapist only gets my messages after I've sent them multiple times. I also have no way to know the message was received until my therapist responds. As you might imagine, this can be extremely frustrating in a primarily text-based app.",4

As a busy IT professional, mother, and caregiver to a disabled adult; having the space to get the support and feedback I need so I can keep working for the people who depend on me is priceless.

Whenever I need to just jot some thoughts down or if I'm worried about something, I just drop her a message and she responds.

"('4',)","Review Text 172: I had a great experience with TalkSpace. I work a lot and couldn't find time to see a therapist in person, so I decided to try a teletherapy app and I'm glad I did because I actually prefer the text interface and the asynchronous messaging. It allowed me to process my feelings immediately while giving my therapist a look at how I process my feelings.  The only thing that would make it better would be to offer customers the option of signing up less than a month at the start. It's a bit misleading to advertise a weekly cost if you don't actually offer a weekly subscription or even an introductory period. There also seems to be no way to change your subscription within the app after your initial selection and payment, only to cancel, at which point you are offered a cheaper ""maintenance"" plan, but not the option to switch to a different subscription level.   I'm still waiting to hear back from customer service on when I can expect a refund after changing my subscription to maintenance for the second month since I was already charged for another full month, but my app has already switched my subscription to maintenance. Again, none of this is explained anywhere in the app, so all I can do is wait to hear back from customer service.  The therapy itself and the service model are great, but the company still has some room to improve their business model.",4

My counselor is suggesting books to read ... we set goals for ways for me to deal more productively with some of my family issues and we have a good personal connection because of living in the same state and having young children in the house. It was inconvenient for me to have to leave work and go to an appointment. This has been great because I just leave my message whenever I need to vent or think of a question.

For someone with a schedule (and personality) that doesn't make attending regular therapy sessions convenient, this app is wonderful. Many of the issues that I've been working on are ones that would make conventional therapy very difficult. I can write any time I have something to talk about (and I express myself much better in writing than spoken words). I don't forget things and my therapist has time to review and think before she responds so I feel like I'm getting more in-depth communication. If conventional therapy isn't convenient or possible for you, this is a wonderful alternative.",3

I have my own personal therapist in my pocket and we can send text, audio, photos, and video. Perfect for people in rural areas, busy schedules, or those who can't afford traditional therapy.

"('4',)",Review Text 472: I am actually a mental health professional and was having difficulty at work.  Due to boundary issues with local therapists I turned to Talkspace. Some issues with local therapists included them assuming they knew what was going on at my job or triggering them as we often shared clients.  It was helpful to have an impartial viewpoint to finally figure out my boss was an abusive sociopath and I only suffered from burnout.  I feel the text messaging therapy worked but probably not for all.  While the good thing is Talkspace is coming out with newer face to face technologies.,4

My only complaint is that when I'm typing In the appointment wish I could see more of what I've already said. I type big long posts and it can be annoying to look through them only 3 lines at a time. Maybe a smaller font, or have my entry take up more of the screen space unless I'm switching back to what the therapist said.

Of course, it’s highly dependent on how good of a therapist you get. I think the other reviews make it pretty obvious that some of the therapists are not as good as mine. :-)",4
"('11',)","Review Text 567: I wish this service had existed much sooner, my life would have been so different. Living overseas it has been almost impossible for me to access face to face therapy, and the stress of showing up to a regular appointment, remembering what had occurred to me in the week to discuss, and actually opening my mouth to say difficult things would be very hard. Being able to contact my therapist as and when, and writing rather than speech have let me be much more open, which has made positive change possible. The app is super simple to use even across multiple devices. My therapist is great, I feel she is really helping me through multiple complicated issues arising from an abusive childhood. I have subscribed for 3 month so far and it has been very hard but very good. I will continue to subscribe for as long as it takes.",11
"('4',)","Review Text 574: Very helpful and worth every penny. Experienced working with two different therapists for two different issues and my wife worked with another. The nice thing about the app is that it has an online version that you can type through your web browser and continue the conversation. If you don't want to type you can leave voicemail in the chat stream. All the therapists I worked with and the one my wife worked with had better than stated response times and carried the conversation throughout multiple times in the day beyond the stated minimum expected responses. This made it easy to progress because we didn't have to wait a week or even a day to talk with them.   I don't know if this will replace any traditional counseling because some people need immediate back and forth and face to face time, but for my personality it was perfect.",4
"('3',)","Review Text 579: I've been to traditional therapy times before and I really like being able to get my feelings out anytime I need, not once a week. It's really important to describe what you're feeling in the moment you're still feeling it. Really valuable app!!",3

"('3',)","Review Text 593: I had a rough start getting on here. Talkspace helped me out when paypal seemed more at fault. Paypal paid prematurely with the wrong card and talkspace was emailing back and forth with me until this was solved. Excellent customer service here! Originally I was going to try betterhelp but my money for that is now lost in limbo with groupon. That was a very bad idea. Groupon was awful and the company wasn't helpful. I lost $50 with that mistake. This app is amazing if you get anxious when even thinking about sharing your problems with a therapist in person. Also if you are like me and cant afford the 50 minute rate at an in person therapy session, then this app is better even if you don't suffer from anxiety. My therapist was matched to me while I was sorting through my payment problems. There was no hesitation on their end to get me started in the process. I have only had my therapist a few days but she is definitely a real person. I have a good feeling this is going to be beyond helpful for me. This is definitely worth the $99 a month. If I had enough right now I would go ahead and sign up for three months worth of this service. It feels good to get my feelings down in the moment.",3

"('6',)","Review Text 654: I should start by saying this form of conversation is likely not for everyone. Yes, there are delays - naturally. But what this gave me that I never experienced with other therapies was the time to really mull over my answers or concerns.

At first the responses seemed generic but it was when we were getting to know each other.

This app helps with all of that, everything you post is anonymous, so there is never a fear that someone you know will read it and know you posted it. Any bugs reported are fixed in rapid succession to the report and the developer is very friendly.

I've listened to several audios from SIMPLE HABIT and find what I hear interesting and  helpful. After a few days I started listening to SIMPLE HABIT podcast by Cory.  There are 11 audios each  lasting 5-10 min. Each one gave me something useful to work on for myself. But the one that really called my name, was #10. I knew already that I had found the right app,  but #10, really hit home!  I have to say...Cory makes you feel like you are his only student!  I haven't really listened to any of the other teachers as of yet, but I look forward to listening and becoming more mindful. I also look forward to becoming the person who for most of my years have been miserable, trying to make myself happy...only to be more miserable, to being happy in the moment here and now!  Thank you....",6

"('4',)",Review Text 878: As a Martial Artist for over 30 years I truly love deep breathing meditation. If you do desire to keep thoughts from bombarding your brain; count 5 second breath in through your nose. Make sure you're not breathing in your chest but down in your stomach. Then lightly exhale through your mouth counting 7 seconds. This will absolutely keep your mind in check.,4
"('7',)","Review Text 881: For someone who has frequently meditated using binaural beats, I find this app to be so simple. I've never enjoyed meditation through voice suggestions but the content in here is amazing!  My wife and I decided to meditate with this app after an argument. We clicked on something dealing with anger and frustration and afterwards we were both completely level headed and calm and ready to resolved our issue!  She doesn't even regularly meditate and so the biggest credit goes to it's simpleness and effectiveness. Helps a beginner learn easily and it personally helps me stay consistent. What's 5 minutes a day?",7

"('6',)","Review Text 884: I started using this app a few days ago and I'm loving it. It has a very comfortable UI, it's easy to navigate and find what you're looking for, and the dark background makes it really nice to use even in the dark (it doesn't hurt my eyes). The SOS meditation for depression is really helpful. I loved that there are a lot of female teachers and meditation themes related to the experience of being a woman (like pregnancy, sexual assault, orgasm anxiety, etc). I would like to see a series for people dealing with PTSD. I really wish I could subscribe because the paid content seems great and I'd love to support this amazing work, but unfortunately it's very expensive in my local currency and I can't afford to it. But congrats on the amazing app 💖",6

The background sound clips, there is a noticeable break between the end of the track and it repeating. Smoothing that out and adding more options for background sounds would be great. I loved calms collection of background tracks, but I can't use the one here because of the audio playback issues. 2. I have to force close the app before I'm able to meditate.

There is an annual charge of just under £70 if one decides to continue (though somewhere I saw notice of a monthly charge, which might be better). There are clear details of how to unsubscribe if it isn't for you and there are email contact details for specific questions. So all in all pretty good.",4

It is more than worth it. As someone who struggles with anxiety and depression, it has been a real life-saver for me and has helped me set myself on a path of self-improvement I really needed.

It would be great to have category on top where all the meditations we have marked with a star could be found. I don't like having to search for the meditation I want every time. Also when you finish a series it would be nice to have all the meditations from that series open from that point on instead of having to start it over if you want to listen to a specific one.

I always pictured having to be there for ages to feel a positive change, but no. These really work and because they are guided, you don't have to attempt the impossible: ""think of nothing"". The only small thing i can think of mentioning is that I think the ""n day streak"" is broken, as I do one every day and yet it always says just the one day. This is an entirely minor detail though!

"('1',)",Review Text 180: Thank you for this useful app. It helped me become more aware.,1
"('9',)",Review Text 184: I kept falling pleasantly asleep and waking up right at the end.  It was really relaxing,9
"('9',)","Review Text 1: I've used a LOT of these relaxation sound apps, and I have to say that this is one of the best. My favorite is the cave, a lot of sound apps have rain and wind, but I have not seen one other that has subterranean sounds. That is awesome !",9
"('2',)",Review Text 4: Highly recommend!!  Great app with a lot of customizations for the different sounds - you can add or remove and increase volume on each element as you like.   The timer is great for night time and the option for the isochronic tones is cool too.,2
"('1',)","Review Text 5: Its okay but The are pretty good lots of use and feature to deal with like the timer mode and voice custom sound!  Sound good but then other aps are better then this, for the photo background are okayis....  overall its still good for easy use.",1
"('4',)",Review Text 6: Best sleep noise app (this and their dedicated rain one) keep up the good work guys. Some more sounds would be amazing,4
"('1',)","Review Text 7: This app is wonderful, easy to use, you can easily personalize the settings....I love it. My kids ask for me to turn it on at naptime and I use it nightly for myself. Would definitely recommend to others.",1

"('1',)",Review Text 20: Used it before and m back for it 😊 highly rec0mmend this app who love to be around nature,1
"('4',)",Review Text 93: The cave is my fave! I am lifted from consciousness to another plane that evokes pure serenity! Wonderful.,4
"('5',)",Review Text 103: I love this app. It helps me fall asleep every night and works in the background so i can use it and turn my screen off or use other apps at the same time. I've listened to the tracts so much the loops have gotten obvious but I think the repetition also helps and you can have sound waves playing along with your choice of sound to help with sleeping or studying etc. It's really good for a free app and I'm extremely satisfied with it.,5
"('4',)","Review Text 107: I became addicted to sleep sounds but didn't have an app myself. This is the first one I saw and after reading the positive reviews I gave it a go. I couldn't be happier. Very pleasant selection of sounds and very easy to use: From a volume option controlling the individual  sounds within each ""track"" to a timer to close the application after you've fallen asleep. Perfect app!",4
"('4',)",Review Text 108: The sounds bring me back home.  They don't play all night a major bonus. I have yet to stay awake long enough for it to stop playing. The sounds are perfect and clear with no repeating as far as I know.  The best I have tried.   In the apps you are able to alter which sounds you hear and how frequent or loud.    Now I want one that is wolves.,4
"('4',)","Review Text 109: Best free app for relaxation sounds. The sound quality is way better than many other apps, the controls are easy to use, and the app feels smooth. Some other apps you can even hear the audio track restart and the thunder is too abrupt.  Sometimes when I am listening to the rain sounds I wake up and think it's actually raining out.",4
"('4',)",Review Text 111: Good interface. I love that I can adjust and add individual noises like crickets and footsteps independently. The variety and quality is good. After Google shut down songza and replaced the ambient sounds channels with their own garbage I've only used this. Puts my kids to sleep in no time. The interface is perfect as is.,4
"('2',)","Review Text 112: Haven't slept this well in... forever. This app has a good variety & you can fine tune them to your liking. Timer works great. App does what it promises & provides good quality sounds. It even relaxes my cats & dogs. I use it on my old Samsung Note2, which now serves as my alarm clock. Works great!",2
"('7',)","Review Text 116: I have Calm, Insight Timer, Relax Meditation, Abide and I tried Headspace. You would think just having one app for noise, music, meditation and prayer would be good. But I prefer to have this and Abide together. I use Abide to get ready for homework or meditation, then I use this app with the isochronic tones to do homework or meditate. I have ADHD, so the brainwaves are bonus.",7
"('11',)","Review Text 117: Love, love, love this app! You can run it on a timer or indefinitely. You can access other apps while this one is running. You can adjust the different sounds to your liking (ex. more thunder, quieter rain, more birds chirping, etc.) My lo needs noise all the time, and out of 6 apps tried, this is now the only one I use! Thanks so much for this awesome quality app!",11

"('4',)","Review Text 681: Works just fine on Galaxy Note3. There is a small ad bar that runs at the bottom, but no popups. Very nice sounds, can customise different elements. Wish there was more.  It will run in background when minimized. I ran ""under the tree"" sound which is a rainstorm, then minimized it. And then I opened and ran a fireplace app that is both sound and a visual. So I could watch and hear the fire, with this app running a rainstorm in the background.",4

Depression is an issue that nobody likes to talk about which is the reason why depression can last a long time until people have found the courage to fight it.

Furthermore, I think it's good that the app encourages you to look for professional help, if needed.

The app is for free so you should give it a try. ",5

This monitoring activity is very difficult for some clients. So an app or a game which can help people to boost their moods without much effort is  appreciable. CBM is effortless and works like charm. Theory is effective. The app definitely needs many more features to help clients.,5
"('4',)",Review Text 2: Best one of it's kind I've found thus far.Lack of count down timer that many other apps have reduces my anxiety to begin with. Wish the pics were a bit more realistic and less posed as people often look happy-but-trying-not-to-be which takes away from the point. Haven't tried with my own images yet. Wish there was more data tracking of performance trends. So good but room to improve for sure!,4

Because of my current financial situation I don't sign up for subscriptions. This app and website has recently changed to only show 3 tasks at a time and it didn't take long before the only 3 tasks I could do all require a premium account. I'd be more than happy to pay a small fee for access to content within a track but since this is subscription only I have to stop using. Disappointed.,4
"('3',)",Review Text 13: Happify Plus is great!  But I get why people are upset. It is simply the fact that the free version is so limited and they do not want to pay money to go plus.

Perfect example of how communicating with the staff or devs is always good practice.   To all the non-believers: IF u have an issue, email staff & u may be surprised at the results.

"('4',)","Review Text 1031: It's pretty good, but I have a few ideas and nitpicks. In the cube game I absolutely love the sound, but when you accidentally move a cube along the ground the screech is just this horrible, jarring, urrg it hurts to think about it. Also it gets kinda tiresome hearing the same clink sound again and again, and the squeaky sound in the condensation cleaning could be nice, but only if it isn't used so much Then there are some things I can see no point in, like the finger scale or the singing bowl (which only ever seems to make one sound). Otherwise, I think the app is pretty good. A couple of changes I'd like to see are being able to squash the stress balls when you tap and/or hold on them, because every bone in my hand wants to, and maybe a few more cubes? It frustrates me that I can't make a good pyramid. Also I'd like to  be able to move the cogs around. Please bear in mind all of this is only my personal opinion and I still think its a fairly cool app. 🙃",4

If you don't experience ADHD, good on you, seriously. Only those to which this is part of life, are the only ones that can fully relate.  Regardless, I digress.  I paid for the Quite supplement and appreciate the added diversion. The developer's must have members familiar, inwhich they experience the symtoms of ADHD or they collaborated with people who do.  I highly recommend, as it took hold of me from the get go. Calmed my brain in minutes.  If you like those fidget gadgets, you'll undoubtedly enjoy this.",5

I am very grateful that it is not too challenging, after working on my own very challenging life events.  Suggestions: provide a reset for games with numbers, like the number slide puzzle; increase use of light and colour to create even more beautiful graphics and give the user control of light, with or without a Venetian blind or other device to make light and colour changes. The bookcase is good!  But in addition, provide an alternate setting to the bookcase, like a day at the beach... Look at relaxing water movements, make relaxing sand patterns, listen to the sounds of waves and a gentle breeze moving through the leaves (etc)  Think about a day on or near Waikiki Beach ☺",9

I am so blessed for this app. Such a  positive app to help you form healthy habits and ideas. It helps you love  more. Not just others but yourself too. With courses that take days to  weeks and boost classes that you can read in about 5 minutes and learn tons  from. This app will help you tremendously in ways that really matter. I'd  pay 10 bucks a day for this app. No kidding. Better than a therapist and  cheaper than mistakes in life. At about the cost of a fast food meal for  one month, why not try it and see how much you can love? *Update* Once I  got the one month membership and saw how much it helps, we got an ad for a  lower price for month and yearly memeberships and jumped on it. I got the  year subscription and am soooooo happy to have this app. I feel so in  control and am learning more and more about myself. Things that you'd  easily miss if it weren't for the app. Please, if you feel a loss as to  what to do with life or you feel like its swallowing you up, get this app.  It WILL help.

"('0',)","Review Text 71: This app is amazing in so many ways. It is especially a great tool for self reflection and setting goals. However, I am a little bothered to see emotions being classified as negative or positive. This kind of thinking in and of itself is harmful for ones personal health. All emotions are valuable and a beautiful part of life. The idea that a person should always feel positive is dangerous. It implies that these emotions should be avoided or that there is somehow something wrong with having them. Perhaps that they even somehow are a signal of a poor life when this is simply not the case. It would be nice to see this self reflection portion kept while not categorizing the emotions in this fashion. Otherwise I think this is great work.",0

The content (motivational and informational boosters on a variety of goals) isn't exciting but I may try the paid version to see if it gets better. It seems worth it at least for a couple months. The only thing I dislike is I can't access this content offline (unless I've accessed it online before).

"('0',)","Review Text 516: The closest to an all in one life management app I've found. No alarm/reminder system and occasional problems with connecting to your data because of a lack of offline capabilities, but (even without the premium options) this is way above average in its market.",0

Simply put, the power to record yourself saying your affirmations so effortlessly opens the door to the kind of positive self-talk and creation of truly positive experiences that can shift consciousness and help you heal your life. The music and other touches are amazing, too. You can listen over and over to the same one like a mantra or record and save affirmations using tags you can use to filter. No need to make many separate lists; the filters do all the work. You can also add your own music. Superb. There's no need for multiple apps. This is all you need. You can bet I bought the lifetime access. Best money I've ever invested in my own happiness and well-being.",4

"('4',)",Review Text 41: I liked the map overall all I wish was that there was a super begineer section. One for people who have never done yoga or for some of us overweight who want to indulge. Otherwise it's a good app and I really enjoyed the layout. I uninstalled it as it's something that I cannot do after the 2nd class. I would recommend it to people who have done yoga before or do it now.,4
"('4',)","Review Text 42: I don't have any clue as to why Yoga Track doesn't have a five star rating. I have tried so many different yoga and fitness apps on Google Play and this app is the only one I've kept. I'm going back to work soon here and one of the first things I'm going to do is buy the premium (which is only $20 a year, people. I saw another app that charges $399 a year. )",4
"('4',)","Review Text 45: This is gonna be quite in-depth, because this is just my favourite app ever. It's made with such generosity it deserves  more than just simple praise.   The best of the best, in every way. I've tried many yoga apps and this one just blows my mind with how much you get for completely free. The yearly subscription is 22 dollar and 100% worth the price. 22 dollars a YEAR for unlimited full yoga sequences. Will purchase when I've found a way to practice more often!   About the app; you download (very quickly) videos in which you'll see a yogi do a yoga sequence. A gentle voice very mindfully explains every move and what body parts to move where so even a completely inexperienced person like me can keep up very well.  There's entire courses to download that feature multiple full-length yoga sequences. By doing and finishing sequences, you get points that you can spend on ""buying"" new courses or single sequences. So yes, as far as I know, all content can be unlocked for free. I cannot believe the generosity!    Lastly, the app seems completely ad-free. This is honestly the most fantastic time I've had in any free app, just because it doesn't FEEL free. Nothing feels cheap or skimped on, everything was made with love. That's why it also deserves every penny you can choose to put into it.   All my love to the developers and yogi who devoted so much to make such a gorgeous app! Honestly, thank you. ❤️",4

The videos start simple and slowly build up and emphasize practicing for around ~20min everyday rather than and hour once or twice a week so you see steady increase in flexibility. I don't think you'll ever get truly ""advanced"" but it definitely helps increase flexibility and is helpful so you can have a routine even on the go.

"('4',)",Review Text 287: Its a good app however its sometimes not suitable for those with hearing difficulties. I.e. stick fingers in ears and hummm. Will talk to you while your humming.

I have a lot of anxiety and o tend to stress out easily and I find that this program helps with relaxation as well as after work since my job is physical. I also like the timing of the poses. They are not too short or too long. I would recommend this to anybody.,1

"('1',)",Review Text 441: Just what I was looking for. Getting points and rewards for doing yoga. It makes it like video games that I become engrossed in. One warning i have is that the demonstrator is very classical so be mindful and careful with your own body rather than copying what he does. Look up someone like Sadie Nardini or Kaminoff before using this to learn about how to use these poses with correct alignment for your body.,1

"('4',)","Review Text 477: I love the cohesiveness of the workouts, and that the beginner workouts aren't boring or unchallenging, but they also don't contain poses that are too advanced (so far). Some of the others have a random difficult pose thrown into the sequence and it's hard to work around. The reward system of Kriya points is a good motivation that keeps me coming back. All in all, I love this! Edit: I really miss the yoga wisdom that used to be at the bottom of the home screen. It would help focus me.",4
"('2',)",Review Text 479: Great app for travel. I always have a video at my fingertips even if I don't have wifi access/cell service. The kriya points to earn free classes are also great. My only complaint: the movements can be a little slow pace. I personally prefer a faster pace but overall super happy with the app.,2
"('4',)",Review Text 482: The app is very good however some videos aren't so good. Some are out of sync causing the lesson to end before the audio finishes. Other times it will inform you it's a bad video and force into downloading the video again. I had to turn my phone off to stop it from happening multiple times on the same video. Other than the problem of redownloading videos (which happened once but took a while to fix) the app has been very good I use it everyday.,4

Each time you complete a new session, it gives you an option to rate the video.",4

I tried to follow the beginner's program at least every two days and this 15~30 min yoga has been changing my days. Relaxing and soothing poses are well organized and they also provide personal  assistant service through text messages inside the app. I don't think you have to go to a yoga gym to practice yoga when you have this app right with you.,4
"('7',)","Review Text 526: I've been meditating and working out separately for about a year until I discovered this app. Now, it's allowed me to combine the two. The guided voice is easy to understand allowing me to keep my eyes closed and mind clear. The video acts as a guide post in case I'm not sure what the pose is supposed to feel like. But the video is a little intimidating because dude is super flexible compared to me. But it is also motivation to keep going so I can get there. Thank you for making yoga more accessible to me.",7
"('4',)","Review Text 530: It only lacks my yoga indian master's voice and traditional indian low tone music. :)   Some people like high pitch sounds,  including woman voice,  others prefer low ones.

"('4',)","Review Text 531: So this app is fantastic and I can't recommend it enough! The more yoga you do, the more classes you unlock, which makes sense since you're probably going to want to learn about basic poses first. This app motivates me a lot, and the sequences are well structured and paced. Possible suggestion: have a ""tutorial"" set which explains poses and the different ways you can do them depending on your fitness level? My old yoga teacher always had a few differentiations on a pose if your flexibility wasn't that great",4
"('4',)","Review Text 532: I love this app because you don't have to pay for the classes. Overtime, you earn Kiyra points by doing the app's yoga lessons. There are individual lessons and a full beginner's series for free!

I'm typically a very nervous person and when my nerves get the best of me, my hands shake, I sweat profusely, and worse off, I can't speak. I had music classes today, and had to play a piece I learned for my tutor. Obviously, shaky hands wouldn't do since I play an instrument. But I was so nervous that even my calming playlist won't help me! Then I remembered I had downloaded this app weeks ago so I decided to play around with it while waiting for class to start, and it worked! Well... my nerves didn't magically disappear... but at least I calmed down enough that my hands weren't all that shaky. Thanks to that, I could play my instrument a lot better. I even got a little smile from my tutor (who really isn't all that smiley) after I played. But yeah, that's my lil' story... ahehe... thanks for making this, really! :DDD",11

In a way that you can go and express yourself but you can also talk about nothing or talk about stuff to get other things off your mind. It reminds me of Yahoo answers. But in a more modern, youthful, kind of way. My only complaint is that you cannot report users!

You aren't guaranteed to get support of any sort, and when you do, it may not even be kind or helpful. Most of the people posting here are younger, and there seems to be quite a few predators combing this app for vulnerable young girls; my first night after joining, I saw a post by a young girl announcing that a male member of the app randomly sent her illicit photos via app message. Slightly glitchy, but not enough to ruin the experience. Felt too old to get sufficient support from the current users of this app, so it wasn't for me.",4

I thought that was intresting plan on doing it again on another day  to see if I can duplicate it. It would be interesting to know if heart rate  and hot flashes have a correlation. This is kind of cool and who knows  might be a way to figure out how to stop hot flashes before full onset so I  can be more comfortable. To bad I can't do it when I sleep.

I just need to track my heart rate to make sure I'm in the right zone when working out and this app is exactly what I wanted! Didn't need to invest money on yet another device that will track steps or nutrition; there are apps that do that as well, and now I won't have to worry about lugging a phone, fitness band/HR monitor, earphones, and arm band just to go for a run. Nice and simple 😊",8
"('1',)","Review Text 4963: I have tried apps like this in the past and found them to be a bit inconsistant and inaccurate.  This one seems to use a very effective algorhythm which creates consistantly accurate results and a foolproof user functionallity. I do like that it keeps a record. Only the last 5 for the free version, but still useful. Well done app makers.",1
"('4',)",Review Text 4966: Held my neck pulse with one hand while it read my finger on the other. Watched the little red hearts pop up after every beat. I also like that it starts reading as soon as you open the app. You have to remember to place your finger there before you open it and it logs it automatically. I can take a few quick pulse checks on my morning run.,4
"('8',)","Review Text 4973: I find it very useful...  its saving me 40 dollars...  I have bradycardia, very low heart rate...  I like this because I can see what I need to do to increase my heart rate.  BTW, I don't know about tachy, high heart rate, and accuracy, I haven't had that in 14 years, however, I checked this with the oximeter at the hospital, it was good...  this is also much easier, just sticking your finger on it and you can watch it change while its checking it.",8
"('10',)","Review Text 4983: After a trip to the hospital with a rapid heartbeat I was afraid of a repeat performance. My doctor showed me this app on his phone and I downloaded it in his office. Now I can monitor my heartbeat and know when to be concerned.  Only gave it four stars because of the ads, although they are the least anoying of any app I have.",10
"('1',)","Review Text 4986: I use a sony z3 and works fine. Try to fake it and it can detect the bpm also by creating fake peak. My friend got a Samsung s4 and Samsung led use much power, that's why you get burnt finger as the led heat up and didn't got accurate results on the s4. Should work fine on latest high end device.",1
"('4',)","Review Text 4990: I compared the results for a week with a professional HRM and it's very accurate, on a HTC One at least. It probably depends a lot on the handset. The thing I can't figure out is how to get this data in Google Fit. The upgrade description does not mention this either. Also the commercials in the free version with sound are a bit harsh, you will wake up others when taking your pulse in the morning.",4
"('8',)","Review Text 5011: It does give a very good indication of ones heart rate. I do not take it for 100% correct, but it is very close. Perfect to check heart rate for general tracking (I use it to check if my heart rate is not going out of rhythm).",8
"('8',)","Review Text 5018: Essential companion for this atrial fibrillation (afib) sufferer. It does a fairly accurate job of averaging your rate. Where it shines is a realtime graph of your rhythm. It's not an ECG (I wish), but a suitable alternative until one is developed.",8
"('8',)","Review Text 5026: App is fantastic. I have tested it with my watch which detects pulse, with my blood pressure and heart rate monitor and with a professional equipment at a hospital. The reading was exact, not even a bpm wrong. The full page ad is annoying, please consider removing it.",8
"('6',)","Review Text 5051: I compared the result of this with what I was seeing on my brother's Apple Watch and the numbers were off by 2-4 beats per minute, that's CRAZY GOOD for a camera and flash combination!! The app isn't really that useful but it works but only if the flash and camera lens on your phone is fairly close.",6
"('8',)","Review Text 5061: I rely on the readings daily,  being on beta-blockers with Heart Disease made it a good App to download and try. I have had no problems with it so far plus saving past readings/history is very handy",8
"('10',)","Review Text 5062: This app went from me playing around with an app, pretending to have tons of patients (cause I'm addicted to Grey's Anatomy & wanna be a doctor or surgeon), to absolutely saving my little brother's life! Took him to the ER and it was the same thing the ER residents got. It couldn't be more accurate!!! Love it!",10
"('4',)","Review Text 5064: Got the same reading as when I counted my beats with a timer. I did BOTH,b/c the reviews made me believe it wasn't accurate,  but low & behold, it IS accurate. Great app. Technology NEVER ceases to amaze me. PS. If you don't get an accurate reading, it could be that you don't have good service signal, I had that problem, & the reader paused/froze. I moved to the middle of my living room & started it again, & it worked fine.",4
"('8',)","Review Text 5067: Works great. Keeps a log of past heart rates and is very easy to use. The developers haven't inundated the application with overbearing ads, placing them to appear in between taking the reading and recording it. I'll probably spring for the full version which keeps a longer record and removes the ads. Thanks to the developers for not ruining the application with misplaced ads.",8
"('1',)",Review Text 5085: Just started using it. It appears accurate thus far.  I will check it against my BP monitor.  Read some of the reviews and don't understand the complaint about the light hurting. You aren't supposed to look at the light.,1
"('4',)",Review Text 5087: This worked like a charm. There's very minimal ads that get in your way (helpful tip-use your back button to exit the ad more easily than struggling with the tiny x) Definitely keeping this :),4
"('8',)","Review Text 5095: With left hand holding phone, index finger on back camera lens  I was able to record my heart rate. 2014 I had a mitral valve replaced, I'm contently suffering from elevated heart rate weakness dizziness, I have learned when my heart rate is high which is normal for me anything between 95 -105 sitting .I have found this app to be accurate for me knowing my body and my norm. So far it is accurate, I'm not a robot or paid advertiser. I'm a happy so far scared Father from my condition. Thank you",8
"('4',)",Review Text 5111: I don't know how but it works! Checked it the old fashioned way a dozen times to compare and its been within a beat or two every time and that's good enough for me!,4
"('8',)","Review Text 5128: As someone with afib this is a perfect app for me. I check my heart rate several times a day I'm also an EMT so it serves in my workspace as well, it is very accurate and a great tool to have not only for personal use but for work as well. Thank you for your app it is appreciated.",8
"('4',)","Review Text 5144: Every fitness guru needs this app. I love how quick and simple it is, with no annoying $$$ or signing up for an account. Definitely a handy device! (No pun intended).",4
"('8',)",Review Text 5146: All these skrubz bitching about how it doesnt work -_- works fine for me gave me a rate of 77 bpm I checked my pulse for 15 sec and got 19*4=76 its been pretty consistent for me.,8

"('8',)",Review Text 5161: I compared resting heart rate and workout hear rate with my cardiology readings and they matched within 2 to 3 beats. But sometimes when I do more vigorous workouts it's useless.,8
"('1',)","Review Text 5164: Easy to use, but sometimes it restarts measuring many times. Sometimes fails to measure anything. My biggest gripe is the amount of obtrusive ads.",1
"('8',)","Review Text 5173: I tried several of the free heart rate apps, and this one is by far the best. I checked my pulse by hand with a stop watch while using this the first three times I took it and it was very accurate all three times, so I trust it to be pretty accurate. I see some other people have had issues but I wonder if they were not holding their finger right or don't have the right camera lens or something because I have been using it for two days now and it has done great. Certainly better than the other free HR apps",8
"('3',)",Review Text 5198: You can feel the side of your neck and feel the same beat as your camera is measuring from your finger so anyone can check their accuracy doubts by doing the same with their device,3
"('4',)","Review Text 5204: I have had about 4 phones this last year and every phone I have had had this app installed because it is accurate and informative. I tested this app against doing it manually at different times and during different activities, the results are accurate. If your phone has enough storage to run properly, this app has no problems. I suggest this app for anyone.  The results I get are takin into consideration for my doctor to be aware of, I always listen to a professional opinion first. Thank you.",4
"('4',)","Review Text 5230: Put one finger from other hand over the finger on the camera. That'll stabilize the recording... One suggestion: On exit, the app goes  through checking pulse again. No need. Please fix.",4
"('1',)","Review Text 5267: It works great using the camera/flash on my HTC EVO 4G (3D) phone & Nexus 10 tablet, but to use my Nexus 7 tablet w/o an LED flash, I have to use a pen light to illuminate my fingertip properly. I love the interface & nice timeline feature, which was absent from other free versions of HR monitors. If you need a basic HR monitor that appears very accurate when compared w/ traditional HR detection methods, & you value a nice, clean, easy to follow interface, then I would recommend you give this app a try!",1
"('8',)",Review Text 5270: Surprisingly accurate. (Compared results with Polar heart rate monitor).        The scanner sometimes gets stuck trying to identify a reliable pattern.,8
"('8',)",Review Text 5279: Have been using this app now for several days and have found it quite accurate for measuring pulse rate. Only downer are the frequent ads. Would recommend it though.,8
"('4',)",Review Text 5343: Amazingly it actually works. Hard to believe that the adsorption with each heartbeat changes enough to be detected by the camera.  The App has a lot of advertisements built in.,4

You know the one that pops up when you log into the app. You are given three  options: cancel, the one option that takes you to Playstore, so you can rate it. and feedback.
