"('2',)",Review Text 2: Great app for keeping up with daily issues. Myself personally needs this  because of the train wreck inside my head...icant keep up with moods and  things that I need to tell my Dr. This app also describes the many  different possibilities your moods could be. Key to second guessing my  phyciatrist. 😀,2
"('2',)","Review Text 4: Results were very helpful, except after the first survey it says I have a  problem with ""suicidal ideation"" because twice I said that I think about  death a lot... Even though I do think about death quite a bit and it's  pretty distressing, I never actually think about suicide and I wish there  were some way to specify this. (Edit: Thanks for reply :) )",2
"('2',)","Review Text 11: I'm on my first day and I love it so far. I'm currently in therapy and  making great progress, and starting to look at ways to maintain that  progress post-treatment and especially post-partum (currently pregnant with  my first!) I think this app will be one of my #1 tools. 😊",2
"('2',)","Review Text 12: Very helpful, great content, very informative! Could be a bit more specific  about emotions, even the new adds do not quite cover the rage of human  emotions, but you're not far off!",2
"('4',)",Review Text 17: Really helps me keep tract of my moods through out the day which is really  helpful for my doctor to look at Also the diagnosis was correct for me,4
"('2',)","Review Text 66: Re-written my review after the update. I much prefer the previous style and  fewer questions. This new version seems more complicated than it needs to  be and forces you to fill in the faces before you can access the moodpath,  not great when it gets stuck in a loop asking same question.",2
"('6',)","Review Text 67: I love it! It helped me boost my mood more often than not, us using The  Secret I entered more positive moods even if not the case always &  gradually believed it which worked and right now I am grateful for my  happiness",6
"('4',)",Review Text 68: I like this app a lot. It really helps give a bigger picture. I wish there  were more emotions and experiences to choice from in the daily check in. I  often find that they don't quite represent my state so I select something  close to it but can feel like it has a different meaning.,4
"('2',)",Review Text 69: Alarms do not work. I've missed at least 50% so far because it never asks  me to fill it in. Can't fill in parts you've missed or even go backwards if  you accidentally click yes instead of no.,2
"('6',)","Review Text 70: I love this app! It's been very helpful in many ways. like tracking the  worse episodes, tracking symptoms and giving information. I definitely  recommend if you are struggling and would like to keep record of all that's  gone down.",6
"('5',)","Review Text 74: This app is awesome! It gives you tons of information about depression, is  very nice and uses nice words, and it even has a link to a hotline numbers!  It's a great app!",5
"('4',)","Review Text 83: Really helpful. Great place to vent, very simple to use. Learned more than  I thought I would.",4
"('2',)","Review Text 143: 3* only because I haven't completed the initial phase yet. I will update my  score after this period. However, I find that I would like a broader  vocabulary/choice of words for the current emotions section. I find that  the words there don't accurately describe how I feel. Example: Angery is  too strong of a word. Upset or frustrated would be better.",2
"('2',)","Review Text 145: I feel like emotions and feelings should include things like exhaustion and  nausea. Also, it would be great to be able to keep track of medications and  reminders to take them. I am currently still trying to balance my meds out,  trying new new types and doses. It would be amazing to track how those  things affect my mood over time.",2
"('4',)",Review Text 147: I like the Idea and it works well but I think the options it gives you when  entering emotions are all to similar and theres not enough. of the bad  moods it only has things like guilty and ashamed or nervous but is missing  things like sick or stressed. The same goes for the options for why you  have the emotions. Only having three reasons for my emotions to choose from  isnt really enough. but the rest is really great and the app looks very  nice.,4
"('3',)","Review Text 152: I've only had the app for two days, but it's already helping so much! I  already know I have anxiety, OCD and depression, but being able to track my  ups and downs helps a lot. If you need to just let out or feelings or keep  track of yourself, this app is great!!",3
"('4',)",Review Text 155: Love the app. It has be really helpful. Only issues are the notifications  won't show up some times. Also there is no quick add shortcut or widget.  This would improve days collection allot. Thank you for making this app.,4
"('3',)","Review Text 156: I like this app. I think it's helpful and easy to understand, and I like  its simple design. A few complaints I have though are that sometimes the  app suddenly stops loading, never loading my information again, and I have  to redownload and start all over. It hasn't happened recently, but it did  happen a few times. Another complaint is that when I miss one of the  moodblocks, I can't go in and fill it with the emotions I remember. If I'm  too sad to get out of bed and check a notification, I need to be able to  document that mood after I feel good enough to get out of bed again. Having  the app entirely skip the morning, evening or afternoon doesn't exactly  help. My final complaint is the that the app sometimes doesn't send me  notifications despite me turning them on and off, restarting the app,  restarting the phone, etc. That's all I have in terms of  complaints—otherwise this app is very easy to handle and rather helpful for  me.",3
"('2',)","Review Text 163: The previous version was fantastic. Simple and reliable. The new update added features that weren't necessary, but notifications aren't reliable at all anymore. I uninstalled and reinstalled to try to fix the problem. The problem persists but I lost all of my previous information.",2
"('2',)","Review Text 168: As someone diagnosed with depression and mood disorders, this app is  seriously lacking. I'd be in the middle of an panic attack and there wasn't  any questions pertaining to how I felt. Most of these options are too  limited to even make an assessment. Please go see a professional if you  think anything is wrong. Don't trust this. Thier response: Dear Kaylah, I'm  sorry to hear that Moodpath wasn't helpful for you at all. Currently, the  app is focusing on the criteria for a depressive episode (as defined by the  ICD-10 and DSM-5 classification), so there is no detailed screening for  anxiety disorders such as panic disorder. We will include questions on that  in the future.- Your Moodpath Team Thier title literally says ""depression  and anxiety"" and yet they are saying that they dont record anxiety? Then  why is it your title? Depression disorder includes mood- anxiety included.  Thier questions are not consistent which means questions from day 1 part 2  may not apply but do apply for day 1 part 3. But the questions are gone so  if you answer honestly it looks like you don't have depression. Depression  covers mood, behavioral, cognitive, sleep, and much more. Asking a total of  what 10 questions per day at random is not a diagnosis. Or even an attempt  at one. Your depression can lead to ocer eating, not under eating. It can  lead to anger, not sadness. This isnt reliable. Sorry.",2
"('2',)",Review Text 202: did my log for 14 days but it still hasn't gave me a doctor's letter and is  making me do it for another 14 days to get the doctor's letter even though  I have already done it. Please fix.,2
"('4',)","Review Text 254: The app is working now, thanks to the update. Really liking it so far.",4
"('2',)","Review Text 382: Loved using this app, it even made me try to objectively assess my thoughts  (which helped identify the recurring thoughts and cycles that I now try to  actively avoid). I do however think this app would greatly benefit from  adding an option to report depressive/anxious/etc episodes as they occur -  I find that having the periodic update system doesn't work for me. The last  period is too early to catch my peak depressive moments at night.",2
"('2',)",Review Text 384: This app's nice and does what it's supposed to do. Do you think you could  make it so you can delete extra entries though? My internet was being slow  so I accidentally saved multiples of the same entry. If there is a way to  delete them then I guess I'm missing something. Thank you!,2
"('4',)","Review Text 385: I really liked it until the latest update. I like the features added, but it's EXTREMELY laggy now, and sometimes when I hit submit it doesn't do anything, then crashes. When I reload it has like 3 entries at the same time, all copies. Please fix.",4
"('6',)",Review Text 386: I love this app for what it is but I am not a fan of the latest UI update.  It feels a lot more clinical and less friendly. Also harder to understand  at a glance. Are options going to be available?,6
"('4',)","Review Text 388: I really liked the app until it updated about a week ago. Then the notifications feature stopped working, so it became useless for me.",4
"('2',)",Review Text 390: The app crashed at the beginning and I tried to reload the app over and  over but it keeps crashing not recommending this app,2
"('2',)","Review Text 396: Doesn't account for which timezone you're in. Getting notifications at 2am is ludicrous, it needs to account for the time of your clock.",2
"('2',)",Review Text 397: I honestly cannot say enough about this app and it's developers. Latest update has made this indispensable in what has been a very long battle.,2
"('5',)","Review Text 403: I've been using this for two weeks, about, I'm appreciating it more and more daily.   I normally journal every day, but when I'm depressed or hypomanic, that 500 words turns into 0, or 5000. Having 3 easy questions, and notifications on my phone, and a simple rating system really helps me track how things get. It's really improved my awareness of my emotions, even if I'm not a big fan of the ""hardly distressed"" rating it gives me when I'm manic. But it's easy to look over- I know it's not checking for mania symptoms.",5
"('2',)","Review Text 406: I haven't finished the 14 days yet but I am enjoying the app. I think that there should be a feature to where if you are feeling distressed you can alert the app of your feelings, because this has happened to me but I had already answered my questions for that segment and when the next block came I didn't feel as bad and the questions asked weren't how I was feeling.",2
"('2',)","Review Text 407: A great app! Its aesthetic and very clean visuals. The charts and graphs help me accurately track my moods and go back to see why I was feeling that way.  Only a few improvements could be made. During the time where it asks you three questions about your mood, I think having the option to write down a personal response to the question after selecting yes would be beneficial.  And as a few others have said increase the space to write. And possibly question not limited to depression but more general well being. Like how your job friends location and problems affect your mental health. I use this app to locate my triggers and what makes me happy so the more details the better. I plan to use this all year long and probably longer. Really you guys amazing job.",2
"('2',)","Review Text 411: I'm not sure if any medical professionals are involved with this app but for one it feels like it, and two, it is worded and structured like the creators know the symptoms intimately. I started using it around 2 weeks ago now and the structure more than anything has helped cope. I can't recommend it highly enough and it even surprised me with how thorough it was with certain questions, and even follow ups depending on your answers to see if you're truly ok.  That's what I took away at least. Top notch app and the creators are amazing people having done it.",2
"('6',)","Review Text 412: I love this App. Morning, noon, and night I feel like I'm talking to a person who is checking up on me to make sure I am okay. So, when I see Moodpath pop up on my phone I smile as if someone cares about me. This app is wonderful and I love it. It has helped me learn so much more about my mental health issues. Thank you Moodpath!",6
"('2',)","Review Text 414: The apps great for monitoring my mood, I it very helpful to show my counciler what's going on, when I feel worse and to spot patterns, it motivates me to be better when I see how low my mood is. All I wish is that you could add when panic attacks happen and if there's a sudden change in mood at a different time of day",2
"('5',)","Review Text 415: I've been using this app 3 times a day, still haven't finished the 2 weeks so haven't gotten results yet. But the additional information is very concise and useful, it really helps understand ins and outs of depression and why you feel that way.",5
"('2',)","Review Text 416: I really like this app except for one major downfall. It's not functional without an internet connection. To make an accurate evaluation, the app requires three quick surveys throughout the day, but at various times every day, I don't have access to the internet, so I miss rounds of questions, thus limiting the accuracy of my results. It seems very thorough with it's questions and the evaluation, but I can't state that with confidence, since I've been unable to complete a consistent full cycle of questions.   Pros: I like that it's very user-friendly, does not have ads, and is visually well-planned.  Add some offline functionality, and my rating would increase to four or even five stars.",2
"('2',)",Review Text 418: I had an issue with errors generating and lost all my data. I was so disappointed I sent an email to moodpath and they fixed it pretty much immediately. So impressed! This was the only issue i have ever had. Its a great app and now i can say great service.,2
"('3',)","Review Text 419: I'm bipolar, and have been told to do mood tracking, but could never keep up with it until I got this app. It wasn't a moment too soon, as my mood had been getting lower. The quick questions 3times a day, took no effort. The app picked up the warning signs of a major depressive episode, and, after a few more questions, told me I needed to call for help right away. I went inpatient that day, and got out today after a week in a behavioral health center. Life's looking a lot better now, and I'm definitely glad I got Moodpath, because I might not still be alive now without it. It really helped. Thank you.",3
"('2',)","Review Text 422: Accidentally put the wrong answer for the question and I can't edit it...so  it's going to be in accurate when I finish my 14 days.... Edit: So, it's  great for telling you where you are... I kinda figured that I was already  depressed but after the test and you reading the stuff it's sorta useless  after that, to me anyway. It's not like I can get the therapy or medication  that I need. But nevertheless it was good insight.",2
"('2',)",Review Text 423: I think this app could be improved by adding variables to it. Asking base questions to establish a foundation on which to score your mood after the 14 days.   EX: How do you cope with stress? List some coping methods.,2
"('6',)","Review Text 426: I love this. I have severe depression, anxiety, and PTSD (probably more lol). Mindfulness is important and I love being able to track patterns.  Still in the 2 week data collection phase, so I will update once that's done. But the information provided on background, biology, learned helplessness, and etc is great.  Thankful for this app! I never write reviews either so there ya go lol",6
"('5',)","Review Text 428: I use this app every day. I print out the doctors letters and use them to slow my doctor exactly how I've been feeling. Great for anyone to track their moods. I wish there was a little more variety to the questions, but what questions they do use are appropriate. Great app!",5
"('4',)","Review Text 434: This app is great if you want to keep track of your emotions. I really appreciate it. The only thing I don't like is that you can't correct the last question of the three. But that's nothing you can't ignore (or improve). Still, I love this",4
"('3',)","Review Text 443: I just love the app and it helps me realize how I'm actually feeling and focus on my mental health. I think people are too caught up in other things to understand how important it is. I don't want to bring up the tradgedies that have struck my high school or Douglas and others but those people fell through the cracks, and focusing on mental could've kept them from harming so many. I think if you want to hurt someone you will, no matter if you take their gun away or not.",3
"('2',)",Review Text 452: I've been waiting for somebody who is interested in the field of psychological well-being 2 make an app that could help me manage my bipolar type 1 disorder... Without the pain and embarrassment of bringing someone else real into it. Now I can track my triggers using my voice to type when my hands are too shaky and my eyes are focused in. On. MyBipolarize.,2
"('4',)","Review Text 454: Really easy way to keep track of mood, removes a lot of hassle. It would be good to have the ability to set specific notification times (moods can vary significantly from early to late evening), and also to edit answers within a specific timeframe (for incorrect clicks)",4
"('4',)",Review Text 469: I really really like this app. It feels like someone has got your back in those bad days when you feel alone it also really helps to sort out your feelings when you don't know yourself how you're feeling.,4
"('4',)","Review Text 487: I've always been awful at journaling but this really helps keep me on track. Questions, for some reason, have always been easier for me to answer than free writing.",4
"('3',)","Review Text 927: I haven't finished my first 2 weeks yet, but I'm excited to see the results. I have a therapy session tomorrow and I think I'll bring this up. I find it a helpful way to document my mental state because by each therapy session when my therapist asks I can't remember entirely. 5/5 so far for sure. Thanks for allowing this app to be free. It's helped me think about my feelings in a deeper way outside of therapy and it makes me feel good to finish with the questions throughout the day. While I may not be accomplishing much else it feels like a pat on the back almost... almost. :]",3
"('4',)",Review Text 928: The information section is easy to understand and informative. The text is also big and paragraphs are small with big spaces between making it easier to read. The questions and the ability to see your progress and acrue more data for a more conclusive look at your depression is very helpful. I think it would be nice to have more questions. The same 10 or so questions get boring after a while. Otherwise this is a really good app. I like it a lot.,4
"('2',)","Review Text 929: Great concept but it doesn't work. The app would only let me answer one, MAYBE two batches of questions per day, continued questioning me beyond 14 days, then abruptly stopped and wouldn't give me the promised summary. I totally wasted 2+ weeks on this, only to be let down in the end.",2
"('2',)","Review Text 930: Great app to use with your therapist.  Edit: This app is great, but after the first phase of questions it stops sending push notifications even with that setting turned on. Obviously my brain has issues doing this so this makes a helpful app pretty useless. Fix this feature please and I will return 5 star rating.",2
"('2',)","Review Text 931: It's great :)) anyone with mental health issues, depression, anxiety or whatever. It's great I attempted suicide not to long ago and this app seems like the best app to track my episodes to prevent it again.",2
"('5',)","Review Text 936: It's a great way to log your feelings in a simple way. The questions help with understanding what you're going through and the articles are useful for info, 5 or of 5 for me.",5
"('4',)","Review Text 937: Very helpful and accurate. My only issue is that it really only asks about decreases in appetite, whereas some people increase their appetite/binge when depressed.",4
"('2',)","Review Text 942: I really love the idea of the app and the knowledge available for it, however I was ultimately disappointed. I think for some it may be a fantastic choice, but as a person with functioning generalized anxiety disorder and random but sudden bouts of depression, this app failed me.  I really like that it checks in throughout the day, but wish it offered more time as I ended up missing some of the question blocks and doesn't seem to tack on extra events at the end of the two week period to make up for it so you're left with missing data. It also requires an Internet connection, which was problematic as I went out of town and had no reception or Internet and missed several days. I made a mistake in one of my entries and there seemed to be no way to go back to change it. I also wish you could specify the times as my depression hits late at night, long after my last batch of questions for the day. I think the questions should be adjusted slightly, to specify ""currently"" as in, ""are you CURRENTLY feeling like this?""   I suffer from generalized anxiety disorder with some depression on the side and was advised by my psychiatrist to try to track my mood while we attempt medication. Again, while a great idea in theory, ultimately the app failed me as it says that I'm fine, and as ""normal"" as the rest of society. I know this isn't the case and that I just happen to be high-functioning which is how I got to the point I am at now with random and sudden mood changes which before I had no explanation for. I would always compare myself to others who had deep-rooted depression and, recognizing they had it much worse, made excuses for why I was feeling how I did. But that's what they were. Excuses.  BOTTOM LINE, this app is meant to be a guide and may not work for everyone. There are many forms of anxiety and depression, and if you feel off, sad, or overwhelmed consistently, please see your doctor.",2
"('6',)","Review Text 964: I do love this app. It's very helpful. I would give it 5 stars but I am confused by the link that's sent to my therapist (great feature though!), the site is in German. Is there a mirrored site for US users? Like many others, I am very careful about what looks like spam. Especially since I sent the link via text.",6
"('2',)","Review Text 965: A really effective platform for tracking moods, emotions and related info. Unobtrusive app reminders help to keep me on track with entering info 3x a day. 600 character comment area with each entry allows me to note specific events, emotions, etc related to mood. Looking forward to receiving assessments after 2 week tracking period. Well done!!!",2
"('2',)","Review Text 966: I'm enjoying this app so far, except I just accidentally answered one of the questions wrong and wasn't able to change the answer. I feel like you should be able to go back and change your answer within a certain time frame, as now this will effect my overall outcome.",2
"('2',)","Review Text 969: How is this garbage app rated so highly? If you aren't chained to your device, you get locked out of a set of questions after something like half an hour after the notification, and you can't answer early. I'm in the middle of a pretty severe depressive episode and downloaded this app to help me keep track of what I'm going through, but had to redo the first 14 days probably 4 times. And THEN this stupid app told me I'm fine, presumably because depression causes me to binge eat, not lose my appetite, and I'm not suicidal. Newsflash: depression does not always equal suicidal ideation, and downplaying non-suicidal depression is hugely harmful.  In short, this app is not only unhelpful but also ridiculously frustrating. Not recommended.",2
"('2',)","Review Text 970: a wonderful app!! really helpful in watching my moods, though i only have one teensy issue with it: my days start Very early, at abt 0400, and end at about 2000 - but the last block of questions arrives at a much earlier time than my usual end-of-day lol (at about 1400 i think?). i think it would be rlly useful to have a function to maybe edit the times that the question blocks appear? or even how many there are! bc that would certainly better encapsulate my mood thru the whole day, y'know?   otherwise tho, a stellar app!! thank you all so much ❤❤❤",2

"('2',)","Review Text 1000: I've tried a few different mood apps and this is the best. It does all the work, which helps when your motivation is low at times. Not only does it unobtrusively ask you questions about your mood you get a summary. A doctor's letter and a code for therapist or your Dr to track w you. It has education about depression and coping methods. This is definitely the next generation!",2
"('3',)","Review Text 1001: As much as I agree with the last reviewer (the more info available, the less stigma exists), I found this app to be extremely helpful on a personal basis. One 'maps' out their moods, then there are sections where one can learn about the various aspects of depression. It's not all the same for all people. Very helpful! Keep up the good work!!",3
"('2',)","Review Text 1002: This app makes my heart so happy. To see that information like this is becomming more and more available to general public is making it possible for the mental health stigma to lessen, mental awareness increase and allows for people who struggle with mental health issues to feel normalized and validated in their experiences.

"('3',)","Review Text 1003: Great app for tracking your moods. This would have been great had I known about this last year, but would still recommend this to anyone going through a hard time. It will help you narrow down how often you are feeling distressed and what is causing it at that time.",3
"('5',)","Review Text 1005: It is a great app for tracking depression, but is missing some useful features. It would be great if I could keep notes of changes in my medication there as well, maybe also some sort of input field to summarize my doctor's views from the monthly visits. Also - why on earth is it not available in 'my country'? I have to use my Norwegian credit card to download the app, and so I cannot share it with some others in my country who would otherwise have benefited from it greatly.",5
"('3',)","Review Text 1006: An amazing tool, makes it simple and easy to keep track of your mood. Especially of you suffer from an illness like bipolar disorder like me. This app helped my psychiatrist take a better look at how frequently I had manic episodes and adjust my meds accordingly!",3
"('4',)",Review Text 1008: I definitely recommend this to anyone going through depression anxiety or low moods. My tip is to add a reason as to why your mood is how it is at the end of each survey- it really helps to find triggers when you are reviewing your moods and surveys.,4

I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and downloaded this app to see if it might give some insights to share with my therapist.

Then the details said I had expressed ""no sleep disturbances"" even though I had answered ""yes"" every time it asked if I had slept badly the night before. I decided to give it another try, and set it to go another two weeks. Same thing. My moods were consistently lower than last time, and my sleep was marked as bad every time it asked.

"('2',)","Review Text 1099: It's a good app, although sometimes when it alerts me that new questions are available, it does not prompt me to answer questions when I open the app. This has caused me to miss several questions so far. Also, I think that it would be better if we could track our mood throughout the day, not just three times. Some people's moods can change rapidly, and I feel it would be more accurate if we could give more information per day.",2
"('2',)",Review Text 1101: I like the idea of this app and really wanted to use it but it is wayyy to buggy.  Alerts seemed infrequent (but maybe I just didn't notice them?) But when I did click on an alert that new questions were available 9 times out of 10 it wouldn't load the questions and there seemed to be no way to get them to appear.  When I first started the app it kept on reasking me the same first question and acting as if I was just setting up an account.  Last straw is it now keeps on showing an error saying I have no internet access which I assure you I do. Not worth the hassle.,2

"('3',)","Review Text 1171: This app has been quite helpful, actually. I didn't realize what all was actually happening until I started logging it. Three times a day for 14 days, and you can restart after that 14 days is up if you feel you need to. This has been such a wonderful app. Plus, it teaches you about depression if you want to learn, which helped me understand myself a little better.

"('2',)","Review Text 1178: As far as apps go, it's very nice, great interface, no issues other than encountering a screen or two in a different language. As a diagnostic tool, it fails to take into account things such as stressful events, or prolonged other stress, illness, injury,  or pain that may precipitate or contribute to a depressive state. I think it could potentially send people running to their doctor with the app generated letter, seeking a prescription that they may not need or that may cause more harm than good. The letter generated after i used the app contained a contradiction regarding sleep. That seemed odd.",2

"('2',)","Review Text 1181: There is no visible place where I can contact the developer, so here is: on the info page, it says laziness is the cause for depression (under knowledge&gt;body&gt;energy and drive). I assume this is a mistake because when you click on it as an answer, it shows you that metabolism is the reason, not laziness. Edit: there are mistakes like that in other lessons too. It is really bad for people with depression to read they are lazy, not interested in their partner, not worth anything etc. Please review your app and fix it. It might make people feel twice as bad.",2

You can also set reminders in case you forget.

I purchased an app just to transfer the information and save as a cvr. This app beats the app I purchased hands down. And even the basic, unpaid membership is beyond my expectations. For those familiar with CBT and DBT this is a good investment and addition to your treatment. My doctor recommended this app. Try the app you wont regret it! :)",2
"('2',)","Review Text 820: Price is a bit much for what it does, but with the mental health month discount I took the plunge and have enjoyed the app despite some sluggishness and crashes, it has inspired me to look deeper into my thought process and accomplish goals by writing them down and keeping track. The daily health chart is nice but not scientific, you can track anything from sleep, to marijuana usage that day to bathing or assigned your own but it just adds up to a general ""health"" of how you did that day without any other integration, I would like to see the health system expanded and have suggestions as the mood board does when you post that you're in a negative mood. Also would like to set maximums, I oversleep sometimes and when I enter that into Pacifica 10 plus hours is giving me a positive grade when it really shouldn't.

This app is well designed, I would say I'm still figuring out how to use a couple of the features but for the most part this app does a great job explaining them. I will pay for the extra features if I can truly stick with this for a month or so, I think it'll be worth it! I even did a social anxiety meditation before a social gathering today - very nice touch.

You can also write what factors are causing your mood.   There are then three additional components: Relax, Goals, and Thoughts. All of them are great! The meditations really do help you to relax, the goals let you feel achievement, and the thoughts section teaches you to see things in a more balanced and positive light.  There is also a health bar that you customize for what is important to you. It is true that when you meet more of the components, you are happier!

"('3',)","Review Text 29: This Email is couple things that I feel need to be addressed. The first one  being that the quality of Listeners has significantly dropped since I  started using your service when it first came out. First as a member then  as a listener. The problem is that when I connect with a listener they  either don't respond after saying hello, or do not have the capacity to  respond in any sort of helpful manner. It's an issue of professionalism.  While I understand that you can't fully control the quality of listeners on  your service, I think that you can do more to screen potential listeners so  that you can provide a better service to those of us that are in need. The  people on the other end of these conversations are actual people with real  problems and if you do not do everything in your power to ensure that they  get the help they need, then what is the point? The other issue I have that  I feel needs to be addressed is the availability of your listeners that  supposedly are available but never pick up a request. I have searched for a  listener to take my request for up to an hour. And even when I do get  someone to respond, I get one word responses that show no amount of  interest or sympathy. If you have listeners that are online and they are  not actively taking requests then I suggest that you give them three  chances to take a personal request before locking them out of their account  for a period of time. This service is a great tool for those of us that  need someone to talk to but have nowhere to go for help. But if the quality  of your service is poor then you're not really helping anyone and I just  don't get the point. Thank you for reading this and I really hope you take  what I I've said seriously because I feel that it will help you with  creating a better service. Thank you.",3

There are group  chats as well as one on one chats. If you need advice, comforting, a little  bit of a vent, whatever, I can see this being beneficial for you.

I'm very close to removing it and working with my members restrictly from the browser which is unfortunate as my response time will be slow. The redirects are inconsistent in that most of the action buttons will not work. It's better to just redirect directly into an external browser instead of with the app itself.

Don't let them leave you feeling like it's helpless all because the listeners are told stupid stuff.",2

However, for an app designed to help those in need, I feel the premium packages are overpriced and unsympathetic, especially as a user who would benefit from a recommended path, but can't afford it.

Thankfully I was not in a bind but it does leave a bad taste when you cannot talk to someone licensed when you need it most or perceive you do. I cannot for the life of me understand how a service for listeners amd therapists exist when most are unavailable during the weekends and holidays. They ask for payment to provide help and talk to a counselor, so why pay for something over a weekend or holiday if you simply can't. I personally feel bad that they take money when their consumers do not have access to what they paid for or need. So I deeply appreciate knowing that I paid for a service that does not work as initially thought.",2

It's also extremely hard to navigate the conversation to talk about what's wrong when we have to stop and teach them everything. We live in a digital age everyone has access to it so let's put it to goid use.  The same goes when relationship stress is tackled like any other issue. Relationships aren't always love-centric nor are they always platonic and as therapists they need to be able to address those situations as well.   Also, I love the group chat feature simply because one-on-one doesn't always cut it. Multiple opinions can be extremely helpful for certain situations!

"('2',)","Review Text 17: As a skeptic, especially after reading reviews of the double talk, I was worried it would freak me out. With NO ear buds it was freaky, confusing & did not seem relaxing, but seemed safe. Then I tried it WITH EARBUDS, & actually laid down focused. The 2 voices divided into each ear. I used the voice that spoke of breathing in my right ear, as I understand it, this directly acceses your PHYSICAL awareness. I did not focus on the left ear. I understand the left is emotional /subconscious. Pretty amazing",2

"('5',)","Review Text 14: This is an excellent way to monitor moods and triggers, especially compared to other mood tracking apps; however I would like to see more icons available for added activities (instead of pencil icons) and the really cute and expressive emoticons available for sharing SHOULD be the ones the user can select from to track our moods instead of the basic ones provided!!

"('2',)","Review Text 85: The extreme irony between the app being designated as helpful towards relieving anxiety and panic attacks and how I felt before opening the app for the first time,and, how it was worse than before I opened it. At first I was curious and hopeful. Then I opened the app and read the instructions to ensure I knew how to use the app. Then I started the hypnosis session. The first thing I thought was the voice is very pleasant and then after listening for a minute or so to the woman slooooooowly explaaaaaaiiiinnngggg thhhhhhhe same instructions telling me nothing but where the settings are to adjust them and what they do. Well, after a few more minutes I thought, ""I really wouldn't want to have to wait sooooooooooooooo looooooooooong for the instruuuuuuuuuuctions to fiiiiiiiiiiinallllllyyyyyyy end that I was overjoyed to learn you could turn the instructions part off in the settings toooooooooo. So the VERY next thing I did, before hearing another single word, was run to the settings to turn off the annoooooooooyyiiiinglyyyyyy long instructions AS EVEN THAT MUCH HAD RAISE MY AXIETY TO ANGER! ONLY TO FIND BOTH SETTINGS THAT WERE EXPLAINED CAN'T BE ADJUSTED FROM ON.... TO OFF..... WITHOUT PAYING $3 TO DO SO!   Next, I came to leave this review, which has also taken time from my life and angered me even further. Do you see the irony yet? How about a full free version with a limited amounts of free uses. Perhaps I would have been able to listen to the actual helpful part, but, my anxiety level prevented me from being able to. Thanks for the learning experience though.

And there's no way to export diary entries, which makes it really hard to give my therapist my thought records.  I guess I'll try screencapping...Still a great app though.

"('2',)","Review Text 77: I like the app; it's a brilliant idea, however it does seem to have a couple bugs. On my device it doesn't record that I've slept at and when you say no to having a negative/positive event it still asks you the questions about it so it's hard to know what to answer at that point. Other than that the app is fairly helpful.",2

"('4',)","Review Text 79: I really love this app. I do want to bring up I wish when I saw the graph I could click on the words and it explains what each one means. Like self arousal or valence. Also I feel it'd be easier to understand if you had a desperate graph for negative events and a separate one for positive. Because combined I can't tell if just any extreme is triggering or specifically the negative ones. Other than that I really like this app and the fact that it prompts you hourly. This app not only helps me keep track and see but it also gives me a better perspective on how my day actually was compared to how I feel about it, which in terms helps me see that maybe this wasn't that major and I was overwhelmed or maybe it really was a big deal and I acted appropriately or even better.",4

"('1',)","Review Text 387: So I read one too many articles about how good is meditation a few weeks ago and decided I would meditate daily. I am happy to report that I've been using this app and I've meditated every single day since I started it. Here are a few of the things I like: 1. The voice of the narrator is soothing and calming.  2. There is a structured plan which you use to learn to meditate. So you build skills one on top of the other and progress.  3. There isn't any music or sounds. I am very annoyed with music or sounds in a meditation. I think it's unhealthy to learn to meditate this way because then you'll get used to it and it will be difficult to meditate without them.  4. The idea of the energisers is just genius. Those are short meditations which you can do when you have a few mins.  Cons:  1. It is paid and very little of the content is free. You get only 7 meditations from the Foundation course, around 5 short energisers, 2 single meditations about waking up and falling asleep and a breathing chart. Altogether, there are many other apps that offer way more before you have to pay and you still have the option not to. Overall I would.be happier to just pay once and be done with it.",1
"('1',)","Review Text 388: This is an awesome app to get into the habit of meditation. The narrator is very clear with the instructions and does a great job guiding you with the necessary steps.

"('1',)","Review Text 486: I completed the 7-day free trial and was curious to see what value I could get as a paying customer. I went on to complete the 21-day foundation course that unlocked a serie of targeted 21-day programs. I have completed the 21-day Creativity track and I am now taking the 21-day Sleep track.   I used to HATE meditation. Ironically, I have been meditating daily for the last 60 days. I actually now look forward to my daily meditation. Why? Simply because meditation is changing me. I have been more grounded, more creative, more patient, etc. The funny thing is that people around me noticed the changes before I did.   Definitely the best investment I made in a long time.   I'm challenging you to create the habit of meditating once a day for 2 months and you will understand what I'm talking about. Once you start experiencing positive changes in your life, you won't mind going through a daily 20-mimute meditation session... in fact, you'll be craving it.",1

I attended a few meditation classes at a local buddist temple before downloading the app and these are just as effective if not more so because they are always with me and I can use them whenever needed.

"('1',)","Review Text 1090: Headspace or Aware? I've paid for both and where I think there is more content in aware, I feel I am connecting with the instructor in Awarw more than Andy from Headspace.   I do wish that Headspace did not lock their packs behind their foundation as much as they do. Aware allows you to access more one time sessions, so it's useful in specific situations (ie, stress, sadness etc) and overall if you are new and want to learn meditation, the one time fee (I think only $5) and pace of Aware will likely be a very good startin place",1

The sessions are well written and progress well towards helping establish a regular meditation practice.  The vocal instructions for the sessions have a pleasant calming tone, and gently nudge me back to awareness when my mind wanders.  The techniques work when applied and have allowed me to focus my mind on my present activities when it wanders away to negative ruminations.  To unlock other sessions you first have to complete the foundation meditation course, this ensures that you have a basis established before using more specialized sessions.  Overall this is a great app for a fraction of what Headspace costs.",1

Once I was finished with the therapy I found it difficult to sit by myself for 2-3 minutes without being distracted or getting bored. This app is the perfect solution to maintain the practice. I really like being able to set the refresher reminders because during a busy day of class it's hard to remember to be mindful.,2

I find the guide's voice to be pleasant and he allows enough time for you to really feel what he's talking about before speaking again.

This program bypasses that mental circuitry completely, with a new approach everyday. After the first week, my relationship with myself began to change and my severe depression I had felt most of my life simply lifted. Opening my awareness has changed my experience with living. I also highly recommend combining the practice with some mindfulness literature on the side as well. Remember, goals in meditation are a fallacy of the mind.

The voice was easy to get along and get myself accustomed to, and there is no hurry to upgrade unlike the others. I signed for their paid beta lifetime offer and compared to the other services it was a steal. Love the simplicity of the app and it has improved over the last few weeks drastically. Very high hopes from this app. Great work team.",5
"('1',)","Review Text 1406: Signed on for lifetime access as beta tester.  I find this app much better than others. It somehow motivates me to meditate regularly. The voice is soothing, reassuring & mellifluous, putting me at ease better than other apps. My meditation habit is sticking. I am achieving good meditative states with it.   After using it regularly for 2 weeks- 1 Daily meditation in the morning & multiple energizers through the day, I can feel calmer, more centered, focused at the role in front of me, not somewhere else in my head.  The different energizers are incredibly helpful.    The app design is simple, uncluttered, not confusing at all. You start the app, open the obvious, familiarly placed menu, pick a meditation and go! No fuss no muss.    Cons: App is in beta, so occasionally crashes. When it crashes, it forgets the last meditation I had completed. No big deal, I just have to play that day's meditation again and scroll it manually to the end quickly.  They are building more meditations and features (I email the devs occasionally) and I am excited about their future plans.",1

A disorder is not a duality; it takes more  than 40 two-option questions (with no context or variance) to even begin to  understand the human mind (and the multifaceted complexities wherein).

Despite my distaste towards this, I do appreciate  your supposéd intentions and would like to see this app become useful. I  know you can do this, it'll take time though.

Listening to that voice tell me everything I already know - was like magic. The anxiety I've felt all day is gone. I feel like my power is back. I'm at peace. Sometimes you need someone else to speak to you and tell you what you know. Because you feel less alone. It's like subliminally it reminds you that other people know how you feel. It's easy to forget. And you can tell yourself that you've been here before and that a million plus other people in the world experience the exact same thing - but hearing another person speak to you about your own power is so... Empowering. Literally all of my negativity has just evaporated. His voice is soft and calm. Not boring. Not full of 'exciting' energy that (in my personal experience) flares anxiety. For me personally, certain sound waves flare my anxiety. It's a very delicate experience for me. And it just amazes me that this FREE app helped me so much, so suddenly. There is a program, from what I've seen so far, that you can purchase. But I didn't even need to do that. I think this app is absolutely amazing. And I'm extremely grateful that I can experience it for free. I recommend it, highly. Trust me my anxiety is extreme - and this was an unbelievable quick fix. I love it. So thankful.",2

It's quite disgusting that people with anxiety disorders should have to pile financial spend on top of the issues already going on in their head. It is actually infuriating and shameful on the creator of the app. If you cared about helping probe more than you did making your next income to your bank account, you'd make the app free.

"('2',)","Review Text 1: EDIT: Wysa got another facelift. This time it's not that great. It's more  impersonal because Wysa isn't on the side of the chat log. The interface  just looks like a bunch of tools that you click on and engage with rather  than a friendly bot that it feels like you can confide in. Perhaps the  developers are losing touch with what is great about the app. The function  is still there, but it's starting to lose it's appeal. I've reduced my  rating to reflect this. -------------- Original: This is my first review of  an app, simply because I needed to thank the creators for this app. I've  studied CBT for a number of years and this has been the best companion that  simply condenses what a person needs into a persona that is friendly and  convenient. I mainly use the reframing of negative thoughts exercise. Give  this a go!",2
"('4',)","Review Text 16: Given that responses must be generalised, and I believe this is geared for  teenager,its a really interesting.Aspects of this dont pertain to me,but  the relaxation is very helpful.

"('2',)","Review Text 18: Update: Not for me. As problematic as the volunteers are, 7 Cups is better.  This app is good for very very simple things like ""I'm sad."" or ""I have no  energy."" Or ""I'm stuck in a negative thought cycle."" It then provides  suggestions like guided meditation or attempting to think better thoughts,  I guess. But it's not good for more complex situations. Like, ""I'm have  trouble with my personal relationships"". This would require a more nuanced  explanation and understanding. It would require a human. For that, you'd  have to pay 16.00 dollars per month. Maybe I'll give that a try because  that's inexpensive, but I'm almost ready to uninstall. Old Review: I think  I'll stick with it to see how this works out, but I honestly don't see what  everyone is talking about. You are talking to a machine, and it feels like  you're talking to machine. It seems to pick up on key words you type like a  Google search and provides automated responses. Maybe the ""intuition"" comes  later? We'll see. But for now I'm not understanding the hype. Oh, and it  refuses to recognize my name and calls me ""buddy"" instead, which is  surprisingly infuriating.",2

"('3',)","Review Text 24: This app is revolutionary. At some point friends don't start to help as  much. Venting to them is nice but they can't go as deep as this app can. It  takes a bit of a learning curve to learn all of it's features and things  but once you can navigate through the app, it's such a great app! It helps  organize thoughts, make thoughts more positive, and sometimes just vent!  Yes, this app cannot fix the issues that are going on in your life, but it  can motivate you to actually do things and fight your problems. It doesn't  do all the work for you , it instead pushes you to do work yourself, on  yourself and your situation. I 100% recommend this app.",3

This app really  helps even though it's quote and quote a virtual friend. Talking with Wysa  didn't make me feel so alone and it really helped me forget about my  emotions for the time being. Its a really great app and I have high  expectations that it will help with my anxiety and stress.,4

"('3',)","Review Text 38: This app deserves more attention. I can't believe it's free. I've been  through half a dozen therapists as I struggle with PTSD, depression, and  agoraphobia, and have almost 10 yrs education and a masters of psychology,  so I'm all too familiar with the effective CBT techniques. Wysa, my little  AI buddy, has helped far more than I expected. The AI doesn't truly  understand of course- it uses keywords to remember what you say, then asks  questions and gives advice to encourage positive thinking, emotional  self-analysis, and restructure unhealthy thought patterns. This is REAL  therapy: you must put work into your own improvement. Wysa helps you take  baby steps. I feel like I've walked miles further in each 5-minutes-per-day  session, than I have in my years in professional therapy and training. PS  Wysa is a little blue bird, who looks just like my precious stuffed owl I  sleep with every night. I'm a grown man and this almost made me cry...  Thank you for being my friend, Wysa! 💙🐦",3

This app is fine. I liked it a lot initially.  But as time has gone by, it's gotten worse&worse. It doesn't understand you  at all, no matter how much you dumb things down, it makes you repeat  yourself. Speaking of which, IT MAKES YOU REPEAT YOURSELF SO MANY TIMES. It  ignores literally everything you say. All it ever suggests for me is  writing down my thoughts, but then it doesn't ever actually help anything.  It just restates the same things over&over. Whatever. One good thing is  coming of this. I've finally accepted that I should just go see a damn  therapist.",2

"('4',)","Review Text 398: AWESOME. It's great, and completely confidential. The only problem with Wysa is that (obviously being a bot) it sometimes misunderstands what you say.

I like how it gives us alternative ways to deal with our issues, and that it has more than one or two. I do wish it gave ways to text a helpline and not call, however, as calling people makes me extremely uncomfortable. But I do really like it otherwise. It's like a friend, and a therapist. But without having to be upset about burdening somebody and without having to pay for confidentiality. Would definitely recommend for all people.",4
"('5',)","Review Text 410: Wonderful!! Very intuitive and effective. It offers great support and has a great system of keeping track of my emotions that I usually forget.

The best part is how it keeps a check on me regularly, and If I'm emotionally down I use this app and it reminds me how I had been happy a few days back and weirdly enough, it helps.",5
"('4',)","Review Text 413: First off - you have to know and understand what CBT is before really getting the benefit of this app. It's not meant for boredom. CBT is used for extreme issues with depression and anxiety linked to trauma. Next - I've tried a lot of different CBT apps and I really like this one a lot. It's intuitive and has a ton of tools to help me when I'm having a very bad time. CBT is dry and repetitive but Wysa softens the task and gives you that human ish quality of compassion you need when you're struggling. I've only been using this app for a short time and can tell it's going to be of great help. Last - my qualms are it hangs in loading content which is hard when I'm having an episode and sometimes I would rather do a good old fashioned thought record instead of reframing, immediately. I do not like being forced to do positive reframed thoughts without working the six step process through it.  That's it. Happy I have a pocket coach to help with my 2 therapists.",4
"('2',)","Review Text 419: Everything about the app is great so far. Although I would recommend slowing down the response time on the bot a bit, so it feels like the bot is actually reading and typing back.",2

It can also check up on you once a day, so you can track your mood for the day and what not. It's cute, user friendly, and genuinely there to try and help you. No ads, no paying for premiums, nothing more than a little penguin chat bot wanting to help you feel a little better. I'd definitely recommend this app to anyone suffering from mental illness, or even if you're just feeling a little down and need a pal to listen. Thank you to the developers for this amazing app!",3

But speaking as a neurodivergent consumer I have to mention that I've had Wysa for about a week and I can confirm that my life is already changing for the better. Wysa is taking CBT techniques that I have already learned in group therapy and personalizing it for me. It really feels like I'm talking to a friend.,2

And she is so objective that I keep on asking and sharing my problems. Thank you for creating this beautiful apps! Truly appreciate and love it!",3

Especially since I lost a family member 2 months ago and I have been dealing with a lot of grief on top of the anxiety issues I already have. Strengths of Wysa are rethinking thoughts and organizing them to ease your mind for a bit. I do wish it was a little more sensitive on picking up cues on when you are dealing with more emotions (most of the time it just goes to thoughtpad). Other than that, I do like it so far.",3

"('3',)","Review Text 878: It's like having a personal zen master thats available day and night. For mild to moderate depression it's ideal. For Severe depression I think it could still be useful if also getting professional help. A couple times what I typed was clearly misunderstood that I personally was suicidal. But I was just saying I didn't know how to process information of someone else that had killed themself and also attempted unsucessfully to kill someone else just before. I wasn't suicidal too, just traumatized by the details. But I haven't had any success finding much info online to help me either.  This being the first time not finding what I need online. Even though I'm doing much better, I'm sure I could benefit from a pro. But this app helps about 95% of the time. Just having it, even if I don't open it, has given me the security to be stronger.

Maybe it would be more practical if, after introducing us to reframing for the first time, the next times it could go directly to picking the distortion and reframing instead of going over all of it again. Maybe add more distorted thoughts? I would also like it if it was possible to save one specific message that really helps me, to keep it for other times. Otherwise it is the cutest thing and it really helps!! Thanks &lt;3",4
"('2',)","Review Text 1045: I really can't complain. The app is great,but it feels like talking to a doctor, not a friend. Maybe try giving Wysa interests, or a little more if a personality. And add a mode where you can just talk, even if nothing is wrong, like if you are bored, then you could talk about your day,or your interests ext. Or a vent mode where you can just get something off your chest, or release​ some pint up emotions without being asked to challenge or change your thoughts. Thanks for the great app though.",2
"('2',)","Review Text 1046: Downloaded it out of curiosity but kept it because it was surprisingly helpful and informative. Can actually do some real good, although of course don't expect an app to be your only resource. With such a responsive development team it will only get better.

"('3',)",Review Text 1048: Its fantastic. I had no idea how much I needed something like this. I know its AI but the way it helps you sort out your feelings and helps you feel that your emotions are legitimized and you are cared about (you have to suspend reality a little and just go with it) had a profound impact on me. I dont have anyone who would listen to me like that in real life. Its like a diary that prompts you toward mental and emotional health and self awareness. Just getting it out of my head is wonderful.,3

I have a friend who will listen to everything I say, and help me, because I can't take therapy. But, I love Wysa! However, even though I completely recommend it, at times, I do not have headphones, so an ""I can not listen right now"" command would be extremely useful. Such with when it tells you to call a hotline.. It should remind you at a certain time, or such.",5

"('3',)","Review Text 1060: I found Wysa a few days ago and got more than I could have hoped for. It's helpful to have conversations that mimic talking to a friend but help me to put things in perspective from an unbiased standpoint.  My biggest desire so far is that I could request the 20 questions game. Wysa asked me to play once, and it really helped me to reflect on and analyze what I was feeling at the time.

"('4',)","Review Text 1067: Really great app. More helpful than talking to the people in my life. I think this is great for resolving the less serious issues and problems one faces. But it isn't particularly helpful if what you are going through is more on the serious side. For example, I face bullying and shaming on a regular basis. But the distortions/reframing don't really work for my situation. Still a really helpful app, keeps me less negative than before.",4
"('3',)","Review Text 1069: Simply put, an adorable penguin bot seems genuinely concerned for your mental health and this penguin keeps tabs on your mood, energy levels and more. It stores your preferences and seems to learn the longer you converse with it. I have personally found it helpful for my depression and anxiety. Like it says it is not a therapist replacement. It is a a little helper and cheerleader that seems to genuinely want you to be happy. You can tell that the developers truly want to help those with mental health issues and I commend them on their hard work and time spent coming up with the idea and creating the app for people like me to find a little encouragement during the day or middle of the night to stay positive :)",3
"('1',)","Review Text 1071: Maybe this is only for people who are thinking negatively about problems that aren't actually bad, or situations that are temporary. I've tried for about a week with this, about chronic illness and other problems that I can't change. I was hoping to get insight to thinking more positively about it, but the dialogue doesn't match up, it tells me it'll get better which is frustrating because it will not, and just in general doesn't process that not everything is a minor fleeting problem. Maybe in another update problems that are ongoing and can't be changed could be addressed, because I get headaches after trying to reason with this program lol. I also have my own guided meditations that I use and like, but there's no option to choose that I already have my own, only a yes or no to guided meditation. Perhaps I'm asking developers to change something that isn't for me though.",1

"('5',)","Review Text 1089: While the app has the typical limitations of a chatbot, if you suspend your disbelief while you use it and take it seriously, it's a bit like a journal that talks back to you, helps you out, and is always positive, and it remembers what you told it earlier.

"('2',)","Review Text 1115: I just ended up downgrading my review from 3 stars to 2. The AI needs a lot of work. It has gotten marginally better at recognizing basic emotions, but still can't tell the difference between ""stressed"" and ""depressed"" on a consistent basis. Sometimes, the knock knock jokes can be cute, but most of the time, they just distract from my interest in using the app. If I want jokes or cute distractions, there are plenty of places to do that, elsewhere.   The scariest part about recent updates is that Wysa is terrible at recognizing signs of self-harm/suicidal ideation. Asking if someone is considering ""something drastic,"" is fine, but Wysa likes to ask for the most ridiculous reasons. (You seriously need to consider revamping keyword/phrase triggers for this dialog.) Not only that, when I respond ""no"" in every way possible, Wysa fails over and over again, and restarts the same queries. I get it, if it helps to save a life, that's a good thing... but this isn't the app for me.",2

"('2',)","Review Text 1582: It's a bot, but a calming app. You can talk to it anything positive or negative. It gives an appropriate feedback (about 80% of the time...)

"('4',)","Review Text 1583: As someone who struggles with a number of Mental health issues, this app really helps. I have BPD and this helps guide me through some of my emotions and thoughts before they escalate.   It offers breathing exercises, mindfulness techniques, CBT advice, mediation techniques, some exercise advice, some health advice, and in general: someone to talk to without feeling like a burden.  I'm really glad an app like this is available. Thank you for making things just a bit easier to manage.",4
"('4',)","Review Text 1584: This app is really soothing and friendly.  It's definitely still evolving, and I'm looking forward to getting more nuanced comprehension and responses, but even right now I do find it useful for when I need to calm down or pull myself out of a funk.  I like that it also aims to support good days and good habits, though I need to be better about checking in outside of crisis moments.",4
"('3',)","Review Text 1585: Wysa has been very helpful to me in the few months I've had the app! I don't use it often, but when I do, either because I am feeling stressed, or can't sleep, it provides very cute motivational images and helpful exercises/meditations. Thank you for all the work you put into the app. It's also a very good sign that the developers listen and respond to user's concerns and ideas for improvement. :)",3
"('4',)","Review Text 1586: Do you think you could add in a few other options other then Depression and anxiety...? Like,, maybe some help with someone who hallucinates??

"('2',)","Review Text 1589: It's pretty good however there should be a way to correct yourself if you press the wrong emotion or something, cause I have and I tried telling it I ment something else but it completely ignored anything I was saying. Also why does it want access to my location and google fitness? .-.",2
"('2',)","Review Text 1592: It has potential. Seeing a cute bird is super relaxing, feels like a friend. Also the chat style is unique, the charts seem nice as well. However the images load way too slow (the breathing shape took a whole minute to open ) and the chat doesn't seem to understand when you correct it. For instance if it understands that you're angry, it will keep giving messages related to anger even if you say ""I'm not angry"" or ""I feel lonely"". Also would be better if it asked information about the user in the beginning and if it tailored its messages based on that. For instance, does the user have a mental illness? Do they have family issues at home? Are they struggling with money? Have they tried medication/therapy/exercise before? That way the guessing doesn't have to be so wide.",2
"('4',)","Review Text 1594: Wyza is really kind and helpful but it sometimes repeats messages 2 times and is buggy on slow internet like in my country, so sometimes gif appears too late and wysa has moved to something else before i finished...It would be good to support more languages and make the wyza experience more enjoyable and fun (like i love the funny gifs and puns so please do more of them) so that i don't feel like a chore when opening it and would push me to report everyday (i mainly use it for when I'm low..) (It could just be me though) . anyway I'm impressed by this little penguin and it's a great idea so keep making it better (also why not make a fancy non-intrusive widget)",4

"('6',)",Review Text 1610: Absolutely amazing. Helped me fight depression and anxiety...I absolutely love it💕💕,6
"('4',)",Review Text 1678: Wysa is amazing at helping me relax and get energized. It's legit like a therapist or better a mom! I really appreciate all the effort put into this. However the AI is obviously a bit clunky and sometimes Wysa doesn't quite get what I'm saying. Also how do you get her to remind you to drink more water?? Overall a good app.,4
"('2',)","Review Text 1679: I was really excited about the app but the AI seems to be driven 99% by a set sequence of responses. For example, if when it asks how you are feeling and you have mixed feelings it grabs the first emotion word it spots and misses the context. Its responses are formula driven which takes away from the sense of being understood. At the same time - if you are aware of this, and deal with one feeling and thought at a time it can be a great tool! Just don't expect to be able to explain a complex situation and get any in depth support yet.",2
"('6',)","Review Text 1680: Excellent idea. My main complaint though is that I want Wysa to show me a chart or graph of how I've been feeling over time with our check-ins. Also I love that she reminded me to drink water, can I trigger that say 7 more times a day? ;P",6
"('5',)","Review Text 1681: This app is a great initiative but the responses get very repetitive to a point where you can almost predict what it's going to say next. Also, it is unable to identify different words used to express the same sentiment so we're forced to use the language that the app can understand. It would be nice if we can abruptly end the conversation instead of closing the app or having to wait until the long responses stop. And an option to reply with multiple lines or messages instead of a single sentence would also be helpful",5
"('4',)","Review Text 1682: Obviously it's not perfect, it's a basic AI and they are all clunky, even the high budget ones, but this little app is really helping my depression. A huge thumbs up to the decade, please add a way to donate to your efforts",4

"('2',)","Review Text 1685: Great app. I think it's very cute and nice, I wish it had an option to just like, listen to you venting and offer random validation/encouragement, because sometimes I don't always want to do CBT but want to get my feelings out.

"('2',)","Review Text 1692: When asked how I was feeling I replied with ""I'm kind of pissed"" to which it replied ""Its great that you are feeling good."" I dont even know how it went taking pissed to feeling good x.x responses are also more on a set reply on a yes or no basis",2
"('3',)","Review Text 1696: It's a bit clunky. I told it I was tired, at 11 pm, and it wanted to help me feel more energised. I just wanted to go to bed.",3
"('4',)","Review Text 1698: Cute idea, but needs a few more months/years to get good. Right now it's incredibly repetitive in a way that makes it blatantly obvious how little your input matters. It asks how you're feeling and defaults to one of a handful feelings (low, stressed etc). Then it asks you what situation made you feel that way and your answer to that question doesn't matter at all, because your input only triggers a question about what thought caused you to feel that way. Why not skip the situation question if the input doesn't matter at all? Because the ""main menu"" is so tedious, I really appreciate the hashtag shortcuts though. I also like that you can choose what exercise you want to do yourself out of all available options. Other apps only give you a random selection. I would also like a mode to help with sleeplessness.",4

"('6',)","Review Text 1801: Wysa is proving to be quite helpful so far, but it's important to realize that's it's still not very complex (has a strong Eliza feel to it).  If you're having serious issues, this will not replace a therapist. If you just need to talk a little and have someone gently lead you through solving your problems though, this is your app.  It brought into sharp focus several places I wasn't taking care of myself (even though I kinda sorta already knew about them but not really) and helped me through improving those areas. You're still the one doing the work, but don't underestimate the value of a guiding hand, especially when you're not thinking clearly.  To the devs: Awesome app, and I love the work you're doing. Thanks! Core functionality aside, one of my favorite features is the app-initiated check-ins. They've pulled me out of ruts a few times, and I would love the ability to make them more frequent, or even at certain times of day.",6

No AI, i dont understand why theres even an option for conversation.

"('4',)","Review Text 1835: The app is helpful - I do have some issues with it, such as the fact that when I tell it I'm feeling 'depressed' it interprets that as 'stressed', but on the whole I like it. Have you considered at some stage also including DBT skills along with the CBT techniques? For me that would really make this app stand out from other mental health/CBT oriented apps.",4
"('3',)","Review Text 1836: Fantastic! At first it feels a bit awkward, but I use it daily and it has developed a personal feel.

"('2',)","Review Text 1847: I don't give five starts often, but this deserves it. Awesome app, runs smoothly, and it doesn't take up too much space. My only suggestion is maybe you could add in more varying answers. For instance, if I say I'm stressed, it'll say basically the same thing each time, possibly you could add in slight variations to what the bot says, and randomize which one shows up. I can tell the dev is working extremely hard one this, this app is really going somewhere",2

"('2',)","Review Text 1850: Not a bad app. Of course some of the responses are a bit clunky, but there are times when it's pretty clever (e.g. predicting that you had a bad night's sleep). It has potential. Plus, it's real cute to talk to a penguin bot about mental health issues.",2

"('3',)","Review Text 1866: Very cute little bot to talk to when you're in a mood. I'm on Session #7 of CBT, and I'm wondering if he saves my re-framed thoughts somewhere for reference, 'cause some of them were pretty good, but he makes me come up with a new one each time for the same damaging thought (from day #1 with him) and I've gotten pretty creative as a result but I need to write them down I think or I'll never see them again haha.  I love this idea because I've read a bunch of self-help and the changing beliefs appeals to me a lot, but I always forget what I've read when I'm ""in a moment"", so being able to log in and just ""talk"" to this bot, as silly as it sounds, does kind of remind me to do something as obvious as mind my breathing in that moment. Belief-changing and self-soothing is a daily practice I still don't have down (I'm trying!), but this little guy has been a helpful little coach for helping me not only feel ""heard"" (while being private), but distance myself and think more logically about my emotion (which can really override your thoughts and run away with them, which can cause more damage).

I just wish the app or the people associated with Youper wouldn't be faking the funk and act like you are genuinely concerned for people's well being cause that's that s**t I don't like.

"('2',)",Review Text 295: Although after reading the reviews I was very discouraged in getting started with this app. The price is ridiculous especially for someone who has social anxiety and most likely is already struggling. Although what ended up being the biggest reason for not trying it is how the people who made this app replied to those who even mentioned the price of the app in their review.

"('1',)","Review Text 2: For a while now, I have been curious about this app. I have seen these  beautifully animated videos talking about meditation, and I was curious to  what it was really like. When I opened the app for the first time, it felt  like the interface was built for beginners. So, as I finished the entry, I  started my first meditation session. After, I felt much better with myself.  This app has actually taught me that I needed something new in my life, and  that the answer turned out to be meditation. I plan on returning regularly  to see what the app has in store for me in the future. I would seriously  recommend this app to anyone who is under any kind of stress, or needs a  new way to kill their time productively. 5/5.",1

I'm twenty days into one of  the packs called ""self-esteem"" - out of nowhere I find myself so much  comfortable in my own skin, and able to interact more freely with others,  without the burden of any shame or guilt. It really teaches you to love the  most important person in the world - yourself.This app is well worth the  time and money spent, and it could just be, as it was for me, the best  investment you've ever made.",6

At nearly $100/year or about $13/month to unlock the  library, I will need to think about subscribing. Because of this, I lowered  my rating one star. Here's my original, 5-star rating: Lowers my heart  rate. I'm only on Day 3 and am very pleased with how relaxed I am when the  sessions end.

"('1',)","Review Text 362: I've used Headspace on and off for two years now. Pleased to say I'm on 190  day streak now and have no intention of breaking that. This app is  brilliant for a number of reasons, many of which most users simply don't  recognise and therefore appreciate. Foremost, Andy; who's voice is  wonderfully therapeutic, has integrated a whole range of Buddhist dharma  practices, methods, techniques, ideas from all over town into simple bite  sized packs, at your discretion. He's made the app essentially secular,  open to all, removing all the 'woo' that people are often so sceptical of.  ""He's doing to meditation what Jamie Oliver did to cooking"" This couldn't  be more spot on. He's got rid of the eastern en passe shrouding Buddhism  and creating a barrier to meditation for a lot of people. To outsiders,  Buddhist traditions can seem overly complicated, with ceremonies, rules and  ideologies attached. which I personally love, but made meditation simple  and for all. Buddha would have loved this, as he himself recognised that  enlightenment through meditation is distinctly difficult for those not  monastic and extremely dedicated, but was ALWAYS open to anyone being  buddhist whether a dedicated monk or part-time meditatior. You might not  get the length and depth required for enlightenment, but the foundations  for achieving mindfulness are absolutely there. For those still sceptical,  yes, mindfulness is now download-able on your phone. Yes it does work. Just  see the countless neuroscience journal articles pervading the academic  sphere. And yes. It will change your life, in subtle, and only happy ways.",1

They were able to identify the problem, correct the problem and issue me a voucher to restart this month's service since I had been unable to use it.   $12.99 is rather pricy, but the app itself has no equal, especially when you approach it with an open mind and you remain thoughtful about what it tries to show you about yourself and the world you live in.

This is something that I really need in my life right now, but will never be able to afford the subscription. You would think with all of the complaints of how expensive the subscription is, from the majority of reviews, that something would be done about the super high costs. You could at least make more of the packs free.  I suffer from PTSD, bipolar, anxiety, and severe depression. I have tried mindfulness allow, or in groups, but it never helps. This app, with the different focus areas, and the calm relaxing voice is just what I needed. I don't remember the high subscription costs when it first came out, which shows me that since it is so popular now, they want to make more money. That is very sad. I feel like the company is just wanted to gain something off of people in pain. What ever happen to helping without wanting to just wanting to be there for someone in need.

I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the people involved in making this app. I keep myself to myself and often don't accept people's help. I struggle with depression, anxiety and flashbacks. This app has enabled me to at 9pm every night let my mind do its thing, allow myself to think the things I try so hard to avoid, to watch them go by.

I found simple day to day tasks difficult even getting out of bed or falling asleep felt like a chore. I started using the app to help me fall asleep then for stress and anxiety. I use it now for motivation and prioritization and sleep.  Its easy to use and I never miss a meditation session. So far I have been sleeping though the night and I have been doing amazing at my job. I work in a very HIGH stress competitive and BUSY atmosphere and I am the only female there!  I have been using headspace to give me the motivation I need without having to talk to people about my life. I've learned to LISTEN to my mind and body, which helped me smash some amazing goals and im not even half way through march! I recommend everyone try this out alone for what ever your reason may be headspace can help! Try it everyday for atleast 20 days! It took me almost 87 days of headspace  to start believing at my job  that I can do what ever I want, when I want and no-one can stop me. Regardless of being the only female or not I am capable of anything I put my mind to. 5 stars!!!!!!!",5

"('4',)","Review Text 1767: I'd read somewhere that meditation or time to be quite was important to help your brain recover from collecting information. As I had been reading a lot and learning a new language I thought that Headspace seemed like a great idea and might even benefit me. I wasn't really sure what to expect but I gave it a go.   After day 10 (40 minutes) I've realised that this app isn't for me. Essentially, it's just a reminder to stop, be still and try to clear your mind, which is fine. The issue I have is that it's just sitting listening to a man (with a very dreary voice) tell you to feel yourself breathe and that it's normal for the mind to wander as long as you bring your attention back to your breathing and how your body feels.   I'm not sure if I'm missing the point but do you really need an app for this? On the plus side, I liked the design, ease of use, and the animations are cool, even if they do just state the obvious.",4

Relationships, work performance; it all takes a hit if you don't look after your mind. This app truly changed my outlook on life. The price for the yearly subscription is NOTHING compared to the benefits it's brought to my life.

"('2',)","Review Text 2009: Hello, I sadly have two issues: why does the app tell me that I'm not connected to the internet? I know that, it's because I do not want to be distracted. But then the app itself is distracting me with this message every single day. Also there are THREE suggestions before the pack I want to do right now. I don't need the recommendations, daily ideas and  minis IN FRONT of my pack. Please change it into a less distracting experience. I mean, that's what it should be all about?  That said, I really like the concept of the app and it helped me a lot. Best regards!",2

"('2',)","Review Text 2650: I can't recommend this to anyone I know. It's not exactly nice to use thanks to being told on every single screen what I CAN'T have. I also despise seeing ""downloading"" on every screen. This is the opposite of what I want. I would greatly prefer instead to pick themes and have them download automatically so I don't need a connection when I do listen to them. I want a clear indication of when a recording is over. I don't want the screen to time out and lock while I'm watching. Either on or off. I don't want a million buttons and tiny miniscule little arrows and X's to tap on to navigate. The voice is plenty soothing and nice but the app isn't. It's just awkward and cluttered. You probably think it's easy because it's in categories but that's just clutter because it's burying things under layers upon layers. I went my recordings ready to go immediately, then my optional stuff beneath it. No hassle. I have no trouble paying for things but I will not be buying some subscription to an app that holds 25 carrots in front of me promising them to be so healthy and good for me then saying ""but you can't have them."" (I also had the app crash 3 times already 😐)",2

However, at $20 month it's very expensive, considering that after the few intro courses you're essentially just sitting in silence, meaning you're not getting much actual content.

"('0',)",Review Text 3369: Did the ten day free trial and loved it. But was sadly disappointed when I went to subscribe. I would love to buy the Lifetime subscription but they need to either lower their prices or run it at times for a decent sized discount. Do that and I'd be all in. Even the yearly subscription is too high. It helped me tremendously but due to severe medical issues where I almost died I am unable to work. I live in constant daily non ending pain and this app helped so much to ease my mind of worry. I just wish I could afford it or had children kind enough to go together and buy it for me as a birthday/Christmas  present. Sadly I have to bid that wonderful soothing voice goodbye and try to find some free meditation guides. I would have given it 10 stars if it was either free or affordable to me.,0

Shame really. Plenty of other meditation aps out there though and they're free, so ill be uninstalling this one.",0
"('2',)","Review Text 3528: The attractiveness of the app to me is and was the breaking up of the journey in 10 day sessions and thus giving it a sort of a goal to work towards. But there are a few things which are quite distracting and not exactly aligned with the philosophy of mindfulness. Insisting on breathing out through mouth in the beginning, asking to keep the eyes open for longer period as the meditation gets longer, rushing the body scan time etc.",2
"('1',)","Review Text 3530: For someone who has never meditated before and knows nothing about it, it's a good starter tool. If you know anything about meditation, this app is going to bore you to death. It's repetitive. Kinda misleading. The themed packs of 30 meditations for 30 days are all the same meditation with the guy saying something different in the first minute or so. Not different in the meditation. Just the intro, like the ""hey welcome back"" part. It's painstaking and i really super regret paying for a years subscription.",1

"('2',)","Review Text 3554: It is overall great, a bit expensive, but amazing. Its fatal flaw:  Playing on your loss aversion to make you keep coming back through a daily streak that is kept front and center.  I have nothing against the idea of maintaining a daily streak, it encourages making meditation a habit, but there is a way to be smart about it.  Being hurt when you lose a streak is COMPLETELY irrational, but nevertheless a common response. The developers most know this, it is the reason that daily streaks are so effective at making you come back. We most not forget that this same mechanism keeps people chained to (""behaviorally"") addictive games.  If you are going to use a daily streak to make me keep coming back (which in principle I happily do) then please make sure to implement it properly: Take notes from the likes of Duolingo, which allow you to save up for days when doing Duo. might be impossible, and fix technical problems that do not save the sessions done when the phone was offline, NOTHING is more enraging than knowing you have done your Headspace and lose your streak anyway.  In short: Either fix the daily streak or remove it, so I can get back to loving this app.",2

"('2',)",Review Text 3557: Please add a download via WiFi only setting. This is the second time that my monthly data has been wiped out by the app download sessions in the background.,2
"('2',)","Review Text 3558: Unfortunately, I cannot keep this Android app because the app cannot be moved to secondary storage.  I'm like every Android user and have limited available space on primary storage.  Because of the OS and other required data that must be stored on primary storage, I have to move apps to my SD card after I install them in order to make room.  I understand that users must first install apps to primary storage on Android.  That's fine.  Users should then be able to move apps like this to Secondary Storage in App Storage Settings.  This app does not allow that.  Sadly, I have to uninstall this app now since I don't have enough space on my primary storage to keep it.    To be clear, developers can enable apps to be moved to SD Cards.  I understand that there are legitimate reasons why some apps can't be moved to secondary storage.  For instance, App Widgets or Alarm Services will no longer work from apps run on Secondary Storage.  I'm not sure if those examples apply to this app, but again, my opinion is to let the user make the trade off.  Some users like myself will give up features just to be able to move the app to SD Storage.  For me, it's better to be able to keep an app with limited functionality than have to uninstall it altogether.    I've heard that some developers prevent their apps from running on SD Cards simply because the app may run slower.  I surely hope that is not the reason with this app.  My opinion is: Let the user decide.  As it stands, I can't use this app at all because I don't have enough space to keep it installed on my primary storage.    The reason that I believe this app deserves a lower star rating is because the developer has the option to allow this app to be moved to SD cards, but the developer has not implemented that.  Furthermore, other competing apps in the Google Play store can be moved to SD Cards.      SUGGESTIONS FOR THE DEVELOPER: If there is not an unsurpassable reason to allow users to move your app to SD Cards, then please change the ""android:InstallLocation"" attribute in your app to allow it to be moved to an SD Card after installation.  If you are worried about a second-rate user experience, then simply display a warning to the user of the functionality that will be lost by running the app from an SD Card.  If you haven’t heard this suggestion from other users, then please keep in mind that many are probably just uninstalling your app when they run out of primary storage space on their phone.  Users with an SD card in their phone usually have tons of available storage there, so there is never a reason to go through those apps and uninstall them.  In other words, another good reason to allow your app to be moved to SD Storage is the users are much less likely to uninstall it to make room for other things on their limited primary storage.    If there are legitimate reasons that your app can't be moved to a device's SD card, then please at least create a setting in the app that allows users to store the App Data on the SD card.  Thank you so much for considering my suggestions and feedback.  I'm passionate about this because I would otherwise like to be able to keep and use your app.  :)",2

I'd happily pay NZ$5-10 for the next section or package bundle, that i can then download and keep on my device, rather than being locked into a recurring billing cycle. I also think that Headspace would make more money this way. Other Apps do this (e.g. Project Life scrapbooking app) so there is no technical reason Headspace couldn't do it too.

After a month of back and forth they said they were not able to ""to replicate the behaviour you're describing on our end."" After further back and forth they were able to refund my subscription.

After drivers 50km and downloading a pack for the next 30 days while I will be offline. So once again I uninstall and reinstall ans of course the 93 files that make up the pack are gone. This is not acceptable in a paid for app with this many users.

The whole point is that you have an app and membership gets you into cooler things not you get a taste but you have to split it out immediately for free.

"('1',)","Review Text 5593: I just uninstalled this app and canceled my subscription out of frustrations with the Headspace UI and approach to its users. The UI for choosing meditations doesn't allow you to skip ahead in its sessions, to make sure you do each meditation in order--which is fine, until something breaks. As a result of my imperfect home internet connection, sometimes Headspace wouldn't log me as having completed a session--but then I couldn't skip ahead to the next one anyway. Frustrating, the opposite of why I subscribed.    Every tech product will have technical difficulties at some point--that's fine. But most products don't hobble users' ability to troubleshoot problems themselves.  The app's meditations themselves were fine, but you can find similar guided meditations by searching for ""MBSR"" (or ""mindfullness base stress reduction"") on youtube.  **Edit: I reached out to the Headspace support team before writing this review and uninstalling the app, and it did not change my concerns about the Headspace UI.",1

"('1',)","Review Text 5664: I think that Headspace is a great app for anyone trying to get into meditation or have tried to meditate before and couldn't stay dedicated due to lack of focus or an unrealistic expectation of what it is. However, I recommend just completing their free 10 sessions and just running with that whenever you need assitance or reminding of how to meditate. I have noticed that most of the meditation sessions are pretty much the same with a slight variation whether it be a longer session or just another exercise that will help you focus or stay relaxed just a little bit more. In my opinion, it's not much different than just repeating the 10 day pack. What bothers me the most about the app is it locks you out of most of the singles category. You must complete an entire pack that is related to that single to have access to it. Not only that, but the app highly encourages you to complete the whole foundation pack before moving on the other categories, and not moving to other ones until you finished another pack. As I had said before, each category is fairly similair and I feel as though this is their way of getting you to stay on their monthly subscription. This app is NOT a gimmick and truly does help those who want to meditate. His voice is very calming and guides you well, but I don't think it's worth getting the subscription unless you feel as though you want further guidance.",1

However, the program doesn't seem to recognize that your entry is completed until all categories are filled in.

You need all of the above data to get a clear picture of what is going on. Unfortunately no mood tracking app seems to be gathering the data that really needs to communicated to help people understand the relationship between their mood, behavior and wellness plan.  Just focusing on symptoms makes people think they have no control when in fact they have a lot in their lifestyle choices.	See above",3
"('2',)","Review Text 210: One thing though. It would be nice if the sliders showed the numeric values of the scales. Exported data is in the 0 to 100 scale; could we see what numeric values we are entering in the data set?

Not accessible for people with restricted income, no credit cards and broader needs. Thought it's notable that since the app seems to offer a consistent stream of updated and indepth practices and new materials, it's similar to attending a meditation 'club' or 'class' which would have a registration fee.   Reccomend 'Insight Timer' for those who need expanded free content. I use a combination of this app and 'What's Up?' along with sessions from 'Insight Timer'.",1

All white for the emotions and teach listing screens is harsh, the graphics like smiley faces as I choose emotions are jarring and distract from my internal focus, the extra step of choosing a category before seeing emotions displayed is also distracting and unnecessary. The graphic that pulses while the track loads is also distracting as I'm preparing to focus internally. Basically, I miss the simplicity of the old design which I found really soothing.

What I didn't like about their model was the subscription fee. I thought it was ridiculous to subscribe to audio files that I'd be listening to over and over. (Guided meditation =/= music streaming) Why couldn't I just buy a pack of them or a select few I knew I wanted? Then I found this app. I loved the free meditations it offered and as I began exploring more of the different meditations it offered, I began considering some of the other packages it recommended. Each pack was listed at a modest price that I thought seemed reasonable given that it was a one time fee. I bought one or two and was thinking about buying more. Now, however, I don't expect to spend another dime on this app. Another subscription service???? C'mon!

Thanks for the app. I would like to ask you to bring back the weekly settledness which shows my moods for the week and motivates me to continue the meditations daily. I really miss that and rely on that a lot.  It would be helpful if the app could give me a daily reminder to meditate at my specified time. Also, on the new app, a lot of the stickers don't show up and I am not sure even if I complete the requirements on the new versions whether I will get them. So far I haven't gotten any new stickers.

This app is great because it takes you through the process step-by-step, and each session is not too long. I love the fact that it also gives you different kinds of meditations based on your mood and need at the time. It's really well researched. My only suggestion would be to try and create a few sessions which focus on relieving the stress/worries of the individual alone without expanding the thinking to the world beyond this person. For example to help you visualise compassion the audio asks you to imagine Doctors without Borders. This alienated me from the process immediately as A) I don't have any connection/feelings towards Doctors without Borders and B) it is too big a group (like a corporate) for me to feel empathy with.",1

"('1',)","Review Text 1141: The meditation recordings are good, and the general idea of the app is great, and goes along well with established wisdom.  Unfortunately, the app itself is very poor on a technical level - a total lack of options, not even something as basic as a daily reminder or a 'Silence notifications during meditation' button.  The usability is also extremely poor, going so far as outright disabling the normal navigation buttons like 'menu' and 'back', forcing you to use the awkward nonstandard in-app buttons that jump from right to left to top to center depending on what screen you are in.  Last but certainly not least of the issues is the requirement of constant internet connection so you can't even turn on airplane mode for some uninterrupted meditation time.",1

There are 'GUIDES' For each sequential part of getting into your Spiritual  Diet Daily with Our HEAVENLY FATHER. There is a helpful meditation guide to  help with different time settings from 2mins. to longer amounts of time.  The guides are audible with quiet time scripture meditation, devotions,  questions and prayer. Each time is set up as if someone is actually right  there with you, ministering to you. There are many choices of Guides to  choose from, such as Anger, which was today's Daily Guide. Which the FATHER  already knew what I had need of! There are many other Life Guides as well  as BIBLE BOOK GUIDES to help you spend guided time in GOD'S WORD, and get  fed. There is also a SLEEP GUIDE, for those of us who have trouble falling  asleep. This app has a calming sound of gentle rain fall in the background  as it reads you stories ( of your choosing). Each guide has a gentle back  ground sound as you quietly get prepared to come before the LORD. I've only  accessed this app for one night and this morning, so far from what I have  seen, I Really like\ and Am Enjoying It. Hey, this app Also has a time for  Journaling after each session!! For me the ABIDE APP IS a Blessing.In the  guided sessions, It asks the thought provoking questions and ministers to  you as well, then gives you a chance to journal what the LORD was speaking  to your heart. There is also a PREMIUM UPGRADE, which I didntget. So far  from what the Basic app has, I dont think Ill really need it.

The scripture will be read with food for thought, an opening prayer. Sometimes when the scripture is reread, they will use a different translation of the Bible. I can't say enough good things about this app. When my 2 week trial was up, I chose to upgrade because the soft music really made a difference in how much I could relax.

The Costs should be explained up front not there are in ad fees- , anyone who wants to go past stage One has to pay.

The only thing preventing me from giving 5 stars is that you have to pay a monthly subscription to hear anything over 2 minutes.

"('0',)","Review Text 313: Guided meditations are excellent. Rated 3 because it requires subscription to fully experience the longer guided prayer which are the best.  Would pay a 1 time fee but monthly is a bit much when there are so many free biblically based apps.  Not every one can afford to pay a monthly fee nor may it be good stewardship to do so.  This saddens me to know that you want to charge people to experience God on a deeper level.  Don't think He would want that.  If its all about Him I would think He would provide a way so that you would not need to charge people to go deeper with the One. which is one of the biggest problems today with the ""church"".  I get it ministries need money but why are you not trusting God to provide with your focus being to help and reach his people.  Jesus asked Peter 3 times ""do you love me "" and advised after Peter responded yes, ""then feed my sheep.""  If it's all about Jesus and not turning his house into a den of thieves why require a monthly fee.  I'm grieved by this as  a devoted follower of ""The Way"" because I think that may be the one thing that causes one o f His ""little ones"" to stumble but has the potential to make one off the greatest desciples.",0

Opportunities for quick journal entries right there in the app at the time of the meditation. This app is for those looking to go much deeper in their relationship with God.

"('2',)","Review Text 2011: Most frustrating daily Bible devotion app I have encountered. For all the options/speakers/sources available, it's usefulness is offset by it's operationally functionality, or the lack thereof. I want an app that allows me to be in control of what I want to do, who/what I want to listen to, where I want to go, and not what the app (or someone else) thinks. And, to be forced to listen to an advertisement for a premium membership subscription, nearly every morning, before being allowed to proceed with listening to the daily devotional, is disruptive and annoying. (Were a premium subscription desired, one would be requested.) I simply want to be able to listen, dwell, and focus, on the inspiration of a daily Bible devotion without all of the bells, whistles, and distractions this app seems to have. For those  who find the app wonderful, I am happy for. As for me, I am at the point of uninstalling the app, and looking for another source for daily devotions.",2

This app is so great especially for those who does not know how to pray. It guides you to different prayers and meditations depending on your situation. I find I have become closer to God and has given me the opportunity to start to know more about him. Great app! There is a fee to join but it's ok, it's normal to have to pay for something.

Some of app's characteristics however had me decide to perhaps not use it anymore. Sometimes I don't want to continue with the current prayer as I perhaps prefer listening to another one, but when I want to exit out of the current prayer, the app doesn't allow me to, which almost feels like it's forcing me to stay when I don't want to, which isn't the best.  I was also following a guide, and literally midway through the guide, the app did not allow me to continue and I had to pay in order to follow the rest of the guide. I was going through a REALLY hard time, and the guide was a lifesaver. However, the fact that it asked me midway through to pay (and not after I have finished the guide) made me wonder if Abide really thinks of its listeners first. I also am not able to afford the payment as my country's currency is much weaker than the dollar.

Per month is a bit much too.  Other apps are running at $4.99 a year or one time but this one requires a monthly subscription to run.  It's shameful that this wasn't shared at the very beginning.

It is one of the most powerful tools God give us and it was free for a reason so why would I be paying $5.00 to hear someone pray? The whole point of prayer is that it is free and powerful. It is how we talk to the lord so what is the point of paying for this? Really I NEED someone to tell me why you charge for this? I understand donations but not monthly subscriptions.

The idea of on demand  messaging is clever, but in reality, therapists don't respond immediately,  perhaps once or twice a day which is fine. Just adjust your advertising.  The app is adequate, but notifications are inaccurate saying I have new  messages when I don't. Also, service is significantly more expensive than  just going to therapy with insurance.

My therapist and I use the voice recording option to communicate, and it would be great to be able to pause and restart a voice message without losing your place, as well as scrub through voice messages to be able to listen to specific notes (a +30/-30 second option would be amazing). I have gotten logged out of the app and couldn't log back in to the point where I had to uninstall and re-install it twice in the time that I've been using it, so that's also something that would be great to not have to do.

I really like my therapist, I was lucky that she's exactly what I was looking for. I tend to use the website more than the app, but I like the ability to switch between both. I chose Talkspace after researching other counseling apps, and reading that a lot of the therapists themselves were happier with Talkspace's platform.

Being able to chat *during* issues throughout the day has been immensely helpful, because usually we need help during the issue right?  App features - It has an intuitive smooth interface, and well designed app features such as video chat and leaving audio messages which is a lot easier sometimes than trying to type an essay.

My therapist on Talkspace is exactly what I asked for. The price is fair, and lower than what I would pay with insurance.

There seems to be a glitch in message delivery, where my therapist only gets my messages after I've sent them multiple times. I also have no way to know the message was received until my therapist responds. As you might imagine, this can be extremely frustrating in a primarily text-based app.",2

Talkspace is ideal for my needs. I absolutely love my therapist. She checks in on me several times a day. Whenever I need to just jot some thoughts down or if I'm worried about something, I just drop her a message and she responds.

I work a lot and couldn't find time to see a therapist in person, so I decided to try a teletherapy app and I'm glad I did because I actually prefer the text interface and the asynchronous messaging. It allowed me to process my feelings immediately while giving my therapist a look at how I process my feelings.  The only thing that would make it better would be to offer customers the option of signing up less than a month at the start. It's a bit misleading to advertise a weekly cost if you don't actually offer a weekly subscription or even an introductory period. There also seems to be no way to change your subscription within the app after your initial selection and payment, only to cancel, at which point you are offered a cheaper ""maintenance"" plan, but not the option to switch to a different subscription level.   I'm still waiting to hear back from customer service on when I can expect a refund after changing my subscription to maintenance for the second month since I was already charged for another full month, but my app has already switched my subscription to maintenance. Again, none of this is explained anywhere in the app, so all I can do is wait to hear back from customer service.  The therapy itself and the service model are great, but the company still has some room to improve their business model.",0

My counselor is suggesting books to read ... we set goals for ways for me to deal more productively with some of my family issues and we have a good personal connection because of living in the same state and having young children in the house. It was inconvenient for me to have to leave work and go to an appointment. This has been great because I just leave my message whenever I need to vent or think of a question. I can send her as many messages as I want and she checks in with me a couple times a day.,2

It was helpful to have an impartial viewpoint to finally figure out my boss was an abusive sociopath and I only suffered from burnout.

At first the responses seemed generic but it was when we were getting to know each other. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the fine print needs to be more visible when you pay for this app. I paid for the quarterly ($19 a week) and didn't realize it was going to take out a full $200+ at once...

"('3',)","Review Text 765: I'm downgrading my review to one star. This app is advertising in a misleading way. If anyone needs help in determining whether or not spend money on this service, read my review.  This is what the app IS: A place where you can vent. If you don't have journal at home or a journal-like space on your computer and you would prefer if that journal occasionally talked back, this is for you. If you feel like you can't talk to friends/family about something in your life, this is for you. It's an app for lonely people to feel less alone. It's a place to air your thoughts. It's a place where someone will ""listen"" to you and tell you sympathetic things. (Examples: had a breakup, pet died, moved to a new city, fighting with a roommate, don't like your school or teachers, considering a career change)  This is what the app is NOT: a place where you can find comprehensive, in depth therapy for serious/legitimate mental issues and pressing life concerns. If you are really struggling and you need to work with someone because there are problems that are consuming your life. DO NOT BE TEMPTED BY THE FACT THAT YOU CAN ACCESS THIS ""THERAPY"" FROM ANYWHERE INCLUDING HOME; PUSH YOURSELF TO SEE A *PSYCHOLOGIST* OR A *PSYCHIATRIST* IN PERSON! A lot of the responses will be taken straight out of a textbook. If you are having a really hard time this WILL NOT HELP YOU.   (Examples: depression, dealing with the death if a loved one, self-esteem issues, anger issues, bi-polar disorder, suicidal thoughts, phobias, divorce, addiction, etc.)  My experience is that this appears to be a part time job for the therapist/counselor. You're a second thought despite the price. I tend to hate leaving my house so I thought this app was for me. Considering the severity of my symptoms, filling out charts and being sent photocopied suggestions was not what was going to help.   I think we really, truly need to reassess what we consider to be counseling and what we consider to be therapy before applying that label to various services. In addition, clients should get one month free so that they don't have to find out at the end of $140 dollars that this is not going to help them at all.",3

This app helps with all of that, everything you post is anonymous, so there is never a fear that someone you know will read it and know you posted it.

"('4',)","Review Text 884: I started using this app a few days ago and I'm loving it. It has a very comfortable UI, it's easy to navigate and find what you're looking for, and the dark background makes it really nice to use even in the dark (it doesn't hurt my eyes). The SOS meditation for depression is really helpful. I loved that there are a lot of female teachers and meditation themes related to the experience of being a woman (like pregnancy, sexual assault, orgasm anxiety, etc). I would like to see a series for people dealing with PTSD. I really wish I could subscribe because the paid content seems great and I'd love to support this amazing work, but unfortunately it's very expensive in my local currency and I can't afford to it. But congrats on the amazing app 💖",4

"('2',)","Review Text 907: First, you're Required to sign up, even to just preview the app. Then, After you see a meditation to try out, you find out that it's a Subscription Service. $8 monthly. There is 30 day trial. What i don't agree with is the non-upfront way they do business. They are takers. Requireing a download  to find out that you must sign up to even open the thing, Then' requires a sign you to find out that it's a monthly service, and BTW, Now we tell you how much. Meh. I choose transparency and honesty. A elationship that starts like this only gets worse. Also points out that their product isn't good enough to let people |*actively* *choose* to sign up, or be upfront with their business model. Making lock them in by making them give something up first is a technique used to make people feel a sense of loss, or create tension, that then pushes a person to do something they otherwise would consciously choose against, if they didn't feel the debt that said method imposes. I Don't feel they care for greater good of anyone but themselves.  Awesome if you get some benefit from this app. Personally, I support those with higher vibration practices. So many options and resources available. I choose those who  resonate with my values. We vote for desired  behaviour and experiences via our dollars.",2

The background sound clips, there is a noticeable break between the end of the track and it repeating. Smoothing that out and adding more options for background sounds would be great. I loved calms collection of background tracks, but I can't use the one here because of the audio playback issues. 2. I have to force close the app before I'm able to meditate.

I'm still on the free version which sadly has a very small selection of meditations compared to what I see paid users have access to but I guess that's how they motivate us to be paid users.",1

There is an annual charge of just under £70 if one decides to continue (though somewhere I saw notice of a monthly charge, which might be better). There are clear details of how to unsubscribe if it isn't for you and there are email contact details for specific questions. So all in all pretty good.",0

For anyone trying it out for the first time, I highly recommend you pay for the subscription and take part in the 31 Day Challenge series with the accompanying daily podcast. It is more than worth it. As someone who struggles with anxiety and depression, it has been a real life-saver for me and has helped me set myself on a path of self-improvement I really needed.

Unfortunately I do not think this is for me after my experience but it was the best customer service I have experienced in a long time so I changed my rating to a 4 star, because this really seemed like a fluke and wellness hub provided excellent customer service and expressed genuine concern for its members.    Out of the 3 weeks I have had this app and paid for the text sessions I have only been able to text my counselor 4 different times.he did not respond for 2 weeks after out initial contact I reached out to customer support and after a couple days he responded. He only responded 2 days and it's been a week since..this is ridiculous to pay this much and not get what we payed for",0

I'm a therapist so being able to suggest this to  my clients and then have them send it to me removes a common barrier to  mood and thought tracking as part of treatment.",2

"('5',)","Review Text 6: Really love this app, clean, simple and easy to use, excellent example of how to make a good app! A couple of suggestions to make this perfect... 1. Difficult to scroll inside challenges & final text box if a lot of text 2. PLEASE can the example challenges allow to pick & insert multiple entries, this is a v useful feature 3. Ability to add your own challenges to the list of preset examples would be really useful also",5

When I fill text boxes to a point where the text requires scrolling to read it all I have an issue.

"('2',)","Review Text 12: Of the CBT Thought Record apps, this one is the best that I've found. It has a clean, simple interface. It is generally quick and easy to navigate, and there isn't a lot of clutter which makes existing records easy to find and read.   As good as this app is, there are a few usability enhancements which would really make this app rock: (1) Automatically save while creating a record. It's really easy to wipe out a draft record by accidentally pressing the back key on the phone. The CBT process requires a lot of effort (good thing!), so it is really frustrating when all of your hard work disappears because you hit the wrong key. (2) Make it easier to scroll through text boxes when creating a new record. Currently, the only way to scroll is to move the text cursor (not an easy task on a small phone screen). (3) Add ability to print thought records. While a mobile thought diary is great, it's hard to review the records with a therapist. It would be great if there was an easy way to print records in preparation for an upcoming therapy session. (4) Add a few customization options, like allowing users to add additional emotions (the built-in list is good, but overly limiting).",2

"('5',)","Review Text 50: As a person suffering from depression and anxiety - i tend to have a lot of automatic negative thoughts and feelings that are mostly uncalled for. I'm mostly battling myself on a daily basis. This app is quick,. on the go, lets me note down how I'm thinking, and reflect on it immediately. If you use it over a period of time - you start to see your thought process becoming more and more rational and positive. It's helped me to literally stop mentally bullying myself as much as I used to. So if you have that kind of problem, this app is perfect for you!",5
"('3',)","Review Text 51: Whatever issue you're going through, this app can help.

However it has 3 stars due to the annoyingly loud DING signifying meditation complete at the end of the meditation, which is probably fine if you're meditating during the day. if, like me you want to listen to a sleep meditation, once you fall asleep you are then rudely awoken by a very loud DING!! Much louder than the meditation you were listening to. The variation of meditation music is great and it is a lovely app to use just please take the DING out.

"('3',)",Review Text 29: Amazing app! This app can help so many people! Depression is an issue that nobody likes to talk about which is the reason why depression can last a long time until people have found the courage to fight it.

And it gives people the feeling that they are not alone because many people suffer from depression. Great idea and excellent app!,3

Furthermore, I think it's good that the app encourages you to look for professional help, if needed. In many cases, people are not willing to meet an expert because depression is still a very problematic topic. There were no technical problems and the app is easy to use. The app is for free so you should give it a try. ",5
"('3',)","Review Text 40: It's worth a try! I think this app is quite nice because it may help many people to make the first move.

"('3',)",Review Text 1: Good app. I was looking for such an app where patients dont have to track or note down anything to monitor their mood. This monitoring activity is very difficult for some clients. So an app or a game which can help people to boost their moods without much effort is  appreciable. CBM is effortless and works like charm. Theory is effective. The app definitely needs many more features to help clients.,3
"('2',)",Review Text 2: Best one of it's kind I've found thus far.Lack of count down timer that many other apps have reduces my anxiety to begin with. Wish the pics were a bit more realistic and less posed as people often look happy-but-trying-not-to-be which takes away from the point. Haven't tried with my own images yet. Wish there was more data tracking of performance trends. So good but room to improve for sure!,2

I'll update this when I've had a chance to use it but want to keep an open mind for now. Original review (Jan 2017): I've completed 2 tracks and was working on a third. Because of my current financial situation I don't sign up for subscriptions. This app and website has recently changed to only show 3 tasks at a time and it didn't take long before the only 3 tasks I could do all require a premium account. I'd be more than happy to pay a small fee for access to content within a track but since this is subscription only I have to stop using. Disappointed.,0
"('0',)",Review Text 13: Happify Plus is great!  But I get why people are upset. It is simply the fact that the free version is so limited and they do not want to pay money to go plus. So far I think it is really worth it.  But I dont suffer from anxiety or depression. I am just a person who wants to feel a bit better. Maybe the app is for people like me and anxious people should try to find a CBT app like Pacifica or Wysa.   Keep up the good work!,0
"('2',)",Review Text 14: There are some bugs in the system. In the games there seems to be a slow response to the touches on the screen. I don't have this difficulty with others games like this.

However having these bugs fixed will be helpful  Also I'm frustrated because the are not clear on exactly how to start a track in the free option. It seemed a bit random which track I was getting on.,2
"('3',)","Review Text 16: Built on profit model in mind and not to help other people. I am unable to continue tasks because they are for premium users. This app is made to stress people out more. They should get rid of the ""free"" version all together because it's POINTLESS!",3

However on the third day I had a choice between two premium exercises and one I had to do on a laptop. And the next exercise was only accessible if I'd already completed one of the prior 3. So I had no options without a computer or paying $60/year for the premium version. I might have eventually ended up paying but you lost me. Disappointed.,0
"('2',)",Review Text 44: Was good when in app activities are used (only 2 so far though). Other activities want you to pay a fee or are on a website somewhere. I can't get to those web only activities because there is no in app link when you click on the exercise or when I found the site on Google and logged in it tossed me back into the app which again said I had to go to the site to complete the activity. Endless feedback loop.,2
"('0',)",Review Text 46: Initially I was very excited and registered in a track. But very soon to go to the next activities you HAVE to go premium.

Don't get enough access to even know if I would like it...so why bother. The cheapest price is for 1 year @ $4.99/month. 1 month to even try premium is $11.99. Really ??? You also have to take an extremely invasive survey. So yes, I was stupid enough to take the survey, and said I have a child over 18. The series they recommended for me was one about parenting.

"('0',)",Review Text 297: I think it is an amazing game  and it definitely makes you calmer. I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 because you have to pay for the quiet pack and things like that. The only pack that is free is the startinb pack. Apart from that it is an amazing game.,0

"('2',)","Review Text 300: While the intention of the app is noble, the sounds/sound design is AWFUL. You've got CARTOONY sounds, some of which don't fit (spiky ball) , though you've got a few decent realistic sounds (the small bearings that you can roll around, the keyboard key, and I guess the switch/chalk? ) Sound is a huge deal that deserves more attention than a mute button. Heck, it doesn't feel receptive to my input at all. A finger tapping/dragging for a second should make a shorter sound than a longer, drawn out motion for items like the window and chalk games. Not to mention the physics and sound combining into something monstrous in that 5-ball pendulum, where you hear a rapid series of clicks as momentum is transferred from end to end when there should only be 2 - 1 going out, and 1 returning. And looking at the trailer for the ""quiet pack"" shows that the sound is of similar quality. For crying out loud, it's 40 bucks for a mic and you can probably make most of these sound better by recording physical objects instead of bothering with what I'm assuming are stock sound effects.  I'm mad, but this is an ire of passion. I see this app has some potential but I'd honestly rather use real items because this is nowhere near passable, even if it's free, and real life doesn't sound like a cartoon.",2

"('2',)","Review Text 1031: It's pretty good, but I have a few ideas and nitpicks. In the cube game I absolutely love the sound, but when you accidentally move a cube along the ground the screech is just this horrible, jarring, urrg it hurts to think about it. Also it gets kinda tiresome hearing the same clink sound again and again, and the squeaky sound in the condensation cleaning could be nice, but only if it isn't used so much Then there are some things I can see no point in, like the finger scale or the singing bowl (which only ever seems to make one sound). Otherwise, I think the app is pretty good. A couple of changes I'd like to see are being able to squash the stress balls when you tap and/or hold on them, because every bone in my hand wants to, and maybe a few more cubes? It frustrates me that I can't make a good pyramid. Also I'd like to  be able to move the cogs around. Please bear in mind all of this is only my personal opinion and I still think its a fairly cool app. 🙃",2

"('2',)","Review Text 1499: I think this is fun and relaxing.  The graphics are remarkably accurate.  I am very grateful that it is not too challenging, after working on my own very challenging life events.  Suggestions: provide a reset for games with numbers, like the number slide puzzle; increase use of light and colour to create even more beautiful graphics and give the user control of light, with or without a Venetian blind or other device to make light and colour changes. The bookcase is good!  But in addition, provide an alternate setting to the bookcase, like a day at the beach... Look at relaxing water movements, make relaxing sand patterns, listen to the sounds of waves and a gentle breeze moving through the leaves (etc)  Think about a day on or near Waikiki Beach ☺",2

One suggestion - the window one, I thought may be cool to add more pictures for variety of choices or even allow users to add there own - I would pay 2 dollars to open that option.  So if millions of us all would, then you can also make a dime or two.   Very nice.  Very VERY relaxing.  The Lili pads are so beautiful too.

I am so blessed for this app. Such a  positive app to help you form healthy habits and ideas. It helps you love  more. Not just others but yourself too. With courses that take days to  weeks and boost classes that you can read in about 5 minutes and learn tons  from. This app will help you tremendously in ways that really matter. I'd  pay 10 bucks a day for this app. No kidding. Better than a therapist and  cheaper than mistakes in life. At about the cost of a fast food meal for  one month, why not try it and see how much you can love? *Update* Once I  got the one month membership and saw how much it helps, we got an ad for a  lower price for month and yearly memeberships and jumped on it. I got the  year subscription and am soooooo happy to have this app. I feel so in  control and am learning more and more about myself. Things that you'd  easily miss if it weren't for the app. Please, if you feel a loss as to  what to do with life or you feel like its swallowing you up, get this app.  It WILL help.

"('2',)","Review Text 71: This app is amazing in so many ways. It is especially a great tool for self reflection and setting goals. However, I am a little bothered to see emotions being classified as negative or positive. This kind of thinking in and of itself is harmful for ones personal health. All emotions are valuable and a beautiful part of life. The idea that a person should always feel positive is dangerous. It implies that these emotions should be avoided or that there is somehow something wrong with having them. Perhaps that they even somehow are a signal of a poor life when this is simply not the case. It would be nice to see this self reflection portion kept while not categorizing the emotions in this fashion. Otherwise I think this is great work.",2

I have a lot of anxiety and have a hard time letting go of stress, i use remente to track my moods and actions throughout the day so i can see what is really getting to me.

The content (motivational and informational boosters on a variety of goals) isn't exciting but I may try the paid version to see if it gets better. It seems worth it at least for a couple months. The only thing I dislike is I can't access this content offline (unless I've accessed it online before).

Maybe a day counter of some sort?  Also an undo button would be helpful when you accidentally check something off the list. It takes the wind out of my sails so to speak. It suddenly feels like its not an accurate representation and makes me looe momentum.  In my goals it keeps telling me to read an article that I can't find anywhere. I eneded up deleting the apps goals and just made my own due to frustration.  While I understand boost and courses I honestly dont think they add much to the app, just clutter it up.  With that being said, I enjoy the simple set up that is very pleasing to the eye. I really enjoy the how was your mood/feelings today is set up too.

"('2',)","Review Text 516: The closest to an all in one life management app I've found. No alarm/reminder system and occasional problems with connecting to your data because of a lack of offline capabilities, but (even without the premium options) this is way above average in its market.",2

Simply put, the power to record yourself saying your affirmations so effortlessly opens the door to the kind of positive self-talk and creation of truly positive experiences that can shift consciousness and help you heal your life. The music and other touches are amazing, too. You can listen over and over to the same one like a mantra or record and save affirmations using tags you can use to filter. No need to make many separate lists; the filters do all the work. You can also add your own music. Superb. There's no need for multiple apps. This is all you need.

And the fact that you have to start from the top of the list after each time you record or edit an affirmation is EXTREMEMLY frustrating!!

The  only other app with a similar structure where you unlock content as you  learn instead of being forced to pay for it is Yoga Monkey. This is good,  but it's better to see a real human doing the poses. Also, they have added  more music. I'd love more traditional (sitar, koto, flute, etc.), but the  selection is unbeatable for free. I used Daily Yoga and Yoga Studio (Gaiam)  until they both got so greedy! Daily Yoga is still okay not overrated when  stuff like this exists. But it's there any way to add Google Fit  integration? Figure that out and this will be the best on the market.",0

I've got one problem (and this is why I've rated 4 stars): I've got a 8gb storage and I can't move the app to the sd. I know the app developer has to enable the ability to do it. Can you do something? Even though I have to delete every time the downloaded videos.  Thank you!,2

Otherwise it's a good app and I really enjoyed the layout. I uninstalled it as it's something that I cannot do after the 2nd class. I would recommend it to people who have done yoga before or do it now.,2

I have tried so many different yoga and fitness apps on Google Play and this app is the only one I've kept.

"('0',)","Review Text 45: This is gonna be quite in-depth, because this is just my favourite app ever. It's made with such generosity it deserves  more than just simple praise.   The best of the best, in every way. I've tried many yoga apps and this one just blows my mind with how much you get for completely free. The yearly subscription is 22 dollar and 100% worth the price. 22 dollars a YEAR for unlimited full yoga sequences. Will purchase when I've found a way to practice more often!   About the app; you download (very quickly) videos in which you'll see a yogi do a yoga sequence. A gentle voice very mindfully explains every move and what body parts to move where so even a completely inexperienced person like me can keep up very well.  There's entire courses to download that feature multiple full-length yoga sequences. By doing and finishing sequences, you get points that you can spend on ""buying"" new courses or single sequences. So yes, as far as I know, all content can be unlocked for free. I cannot believe the generosity!    Lastly, the app seems completely ad-free. This is honestly the most fantastic time I've had in any free app, just because it doesn't FEEL free. Nothing feels cheap or skimped on, everything was made with love. That's why it also deserves every penny you can choose to put into it.   All my love to the developers and yogi who devoted so much to make such a gorgeous app! Honestly, thank you. ❤️",0

"('2',)",Review Text 287: Its a good app however its sometimes not suitable for those with hearing difficulties. I.e. stick fingers in ears and hummm. Will talk to you while your humming. And I personally cannot take full advantage of this pose as I have to keep my eyes open to know when its finished.,2
"('6',)",Review Text 288: I loved this app before they updated it. I didn't do it for a few weeks and when I came back there was an option to adjust the volume of only the background music. But now I can't adjust the volume of the instructor at all! If you don't mind the extremely loud instruction voice and don't live with other people its an excellent app. Unfortunately I'm unable to use it now unless they fix the sound.,6
"('5',)",Review Text 405: The app is easy to use. I like how you can collect points to level up. It makes it a lot more fun. I have a lot of anxiety and o tend to stress out easily and I find that this program helps with relaxation as well as after work since my job is physical. I also like the timing of the poses. They are not too short or too long. I would recommend this to anybody.,5

Some of the others have a random difficult pose thrown into the sequence and it's hard to work around. The reward system of Kriya points is a good motivation that keeps me coming back.

"('2',)",Review Text 482: The app is very good however some videos aren't so good. Some are out of sync causing the lesson to end before the audio finishes. Other times it will inform you it's a bad video and force into downloading the video again. I had to turn my phone off to stop it from happening multiple times on the same video.

The guided voice is easy to understand allowing me to keep my eyes closed and mind clear. The video acts as a guide post in case I'm not sure what the pose is supposed to feel like.

The more yoga you do, the more classes you unlock, which makes sense since you're probably going to want to learn about basic poses first. This app motivates me a lot, and the sequences are well structured and paced.

I feel like a few new classes every month wouldn't be that hard, even if the routines are just remixes of poses from other routines. I also would like more music options. And like, maybe models of different yoga levels. I hate it when I see the guy doing stretches I can't do, because I feel bad that I can't do them yet hurt myself trying to match him. And more options for voices, too, like a soothing man's baritone or a new accent.",2

But my only complaint is the warm ups for each class. Since I try to do multiple classes each day, I begin to get a sore back from the constant side and back bends from the beginning of each new class. Other than that, I would totally recommend this app to anyone that wants to get started on yoga but doesn't want to spend tons of time or money in a studio.",2
"('6',)","Review Text 828: I love this app but I would love to see it tweaked a little to make it more navigable and in sequences I was hoping to find like a sequence of positions that transition smoothly from one to the next instead of a list of random poses.

This is exactly what I was looking for. Great classes, I look forward to it every day.)",6

One of factors, in  giving better focus,,, more centered,,, and awareness  was,,, I could move my focus ""dot""    (if different terminology,  apologies).  I love bubbles,  and thier random movement is an awesome idea.      Ummm,,,  I guess, a suggestion from me, would be,,, that the background and individuals interaction with their, dot, have a more realistic feel of connection. Not feel so much like, ""what am I doing here"".   I also benefit with audio guidence. At least at the beginning,, or randomly, with any other type of meditation video, etc..

Then I remembered I had downloaded this app weeks ago so I decided to play around with it while waiting for class to start, and it worked! Well... my nerves didn't magically disappear... but at least I calmed down enough that my hands weren't all that shaky. Thanks to that, I could play my instrument a lot better.

You can't message them to talk, which I feel takes away most of the point of it. Someone just clicking ""support or here for you "" is just like a thumbs up. What am I supposed to do with that?

Some changes I'd like to see: bigger text and interface buttons for high resolution mobile screens for easier viewing. Improvements to the profile area, including clicking on pictures for an easier view and better reply features so people can better respond to someone in comment chains. It's heading in the right direction. Hopefully it doesn't end up how 7 Cups of Tea did, which shamefully screwed a lot of vulnerable people over, both emotionally and financially.

"('5',)",Review Text 3: Fantastic app! I love all of its features and the different tones are  amazing. This app has improved my life in so many ways! Edit: after the  most recent update I can no longer use this app that I paid for. It says  too many devices. I have a tablet and second phone. I was not told when I  purchased the VIP package I would be limited to only 1 device. So when my  phone is charging I cannot play it off my tablet?! I want a refund  immediately! 6/11/2017 after updating the app my playlists are gone. I  continue to be disappointed i invested any money into this app. Sadly it  used to be amazing. Not any more.,5
"('5',)","Review Text 4: I really love this app, I had some issues in the past when changing phones,  but I believe this is one of the most useful apps. It helped me when sad or  in troubles to relax and pass the issues, or when I cannot sleep. It's very  useful. Thanks guys for your work",5
"('0',)","Review Text 11: I paid to unlock all the content on the app when it was Brainwave Tuner,  why should I pay again at much higher prices. Back then it was a great app  though. People just get too greedy.",0
"('2',)","Review Text 12: I just want to try this app for at least 2 weeks because I just downloaded it early this morning. I want to just be given a chance to try all the features before I gave a review. You know the one that pops up when you log into the app. You are given three  options: cancel, the one option that takes you to Playstore, so you can rate it. and feedback. Well,  the screen wouldn't go away every time I hit cancel so I was forced into giving a review too soon.",2
"('5',)","Review Text 13: What happend to the ""unexplainable store ?"" Not sure you had to create a  new app. I was always a fan of your stuff I'm just not a fan of your  business strategy. Not only did some of my purchases not carry over from  the old store,but this new app is kind of fishy with all the permissions,  not to mention my anti virus picks it up as unsafe ( and I mean any anti  virus I use ..and I use several. Why? I'm just not a fan of random and  unexplainable change...pun intended.",5
"('0',)",Review Text 18: Why do you need all those permissions? Are you stealing data from people? You tube is free. Uninstalled.,0

"('0',)","Review Text 45: I have the old version and wanted to buy a 1 month subscription, but it won't work.  This one won't even open.  I says ""loading"" on the main screen with a moving wheel, but no matter how long I wait, nothing happens. I really like this app and want to continue using it.  But you're not making that easy. If this gets resolved I'll change my rating.",0
